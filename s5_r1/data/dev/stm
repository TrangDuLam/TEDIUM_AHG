AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 13.04 23.46 <o,f0,male> last year i showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower forty eight states has shrunk by forty percent
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 23.46 40.05 <o,f0,male> but this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice the arctic ice cap is in a sense the beating heart of the global climate system it expands in winter and contracts in summer the next slide i show you will be
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 40.05 52.68 <o,f0,male> a rapid fast forward of what's happened over the last twenty five years the permanent ice is marked in red and as you see it expands to the dark blue that's the annual ice in winter and it contracts in summer
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 52.68 60.29 <o,f0,male> and the so called permanent ice five years old or older you can see is almost like blood spilling out of the body here
AlGore_2009 A S28 60.29 62.60 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 62.60 69.05 <o,f0,male> in twenty five years it's gone from this to this this is a problem because the warming
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 69.05 86.33 <o,f0,male> heats up the frozen ground around the arctic ocean where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which when it thaws is turned into methane by microbes compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere that amount could double if we cross this tipping point
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 86.33 97.90 <o,f0,male> already in some shallow lakes in alaska methane is actively bubbling up out of the water professor katey walter from the university of alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter
AlGore_2009 A S12 97.90 110.68 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 110.68 118.30 <o,f0,male> she's okay the question is whether we will be and one reason is this enormous heat sink heats up greenland from the north
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 118.30 126.59 <o,f0,male> this is an annual melting river but the volumes are much larger than ever this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 126.59 135.11 <o,f0,male> greenland if you want to know how sea level rises from land base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea these flows are increasing very rapidly
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 135.11 145.34 <o,f0,male> at the other end of the planet antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance and west antarctica
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 145.34 154.09 <o,f0,male> cropped up on top some under sea islands is particularly rapid in its melting that's equal to twenty feet of sea level as is greenland
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 154.09 168.56 <o,f0,male> in the himalayas the third largest mass of ice at the top you see new lakes which a few years ago were glaciers forty percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow in the andes this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 168.56 186.78 <o,f0,male> the flows have increased but when they go away so does much of the drinking water in california there has been a forty percent decline in the sierra snowpack this is hitting the reservoirs and the predictions as you've read are serious this drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 186.78 205.16 <o,f0,male> and the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate four times as many in the last thirty years as in the previous seventy five this is a completely unsustainable pattern if you look at in the context of history you can see
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 205.16 209.55 <o,f0,male> what this is doing
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 209.55 217.91 <o,f0,male> in the last five years we've added seventy million tons of co two every twenty four hours twenty five million tons every day to the oceans
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 217.91 229.16 <o,f0,male> look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific from the americas extending westward and on either side of the indian subcontinent where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 229.16 236.68 <o,f0,male> the biggest single cause of global warming along with deforestation which is twenty percent of it is the burning of fossil fuels oil is a problem
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 236.68 254.15 <o,f0,male> and coal is the most serious problem the united states is one of the two largest emitters along with china and the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants but we're beginning to see a sea change here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 254.15 270.30 <o,f0,male> however there is a political battle in our country and the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal which is an oxymoron that image reminded me of something

AlGore_2009 A S13 313.04 319.79 <o,f0,male> let me be clear about it al gore nancy pelosi harry reid they don't know what they're talking about
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 319.79 326.07 <o,f0,male> so the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns this is one of them part of one of them
AlGore_2009 A S45 326.07 338.81 <o,f0,male> coalergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business that's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal
AlGore_2009 A S45 338.81 342.42 <o,f0,male> the fact is coal isn't dirty we think it's clean

AlGore_2009 A S45 345.38 350.03 <o,f0,male> so don't worry about climate change leave that up to us

AlGore_2009 A S50 366.43 374.01 <o,f0,male> and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything
AlGore_2009 A S50 374.01 379.09 <o,f0,male> take a good long look this is today's clean coal technology
AlGore_2009 A Al_Gore 379.09 385.34 <o,f0,male> finally the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge
AlGore_2009 A S54 385.34 390.66 <o,f0,male> america is in crisis the economy national security the climate crisis
AlGore_2009 A S54 390.66 396.15 <o,f0,male> the thread that links them all our addiction to carbon based fuels like dirty coal and foreign oil
AlGore_2009 A S54 396.15 400.79 <o,f0,male> but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess repower america
AlGore_2009 A S54 400.79 409.21 <o,f0,male> with one hundred percent clean electricity within ten years a plan to put america back to work make us more secure and help stop global warming
AlGore_2009 A S54 409.21 414.90 <o,f0,male> finally a solution that's big enough to solve our problems repower america find out more

BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 12.24 19.56 <o,f0,male> i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you've already heard and i'll try to
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 19.56 26.89 <o,f0,male> make some connections myself in case you miss them i want to start with what i call the official dogma
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 26.89 38.74 <o,f0,male> the official dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dogma runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 38.74 49.12 <o,f0,male> the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 49.12 62.24 <o,f0,male> valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 62.24 75.46 <o,f0,male> the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice the more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 75.46 89.62 <o,f0,male> this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it's also deeply embedded in our lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 89.62 98.55 <o,f0,male> i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 98.55 105.32 <o,f0,male> i want to say just a word about salad dressing a hundred and seventy five salad dressings in my supermarket if you don't count
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 105.32 118.42 <o,f0,male> the ten extra virgin olive oils and twelve balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings in the off chance that none of the hundred seventy five the store has on offer suit you
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 118.42 129.48 <o,f0,male> so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tuner amplifier and in this one
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 129.48 139.56 <o,f0,male> single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 139.56 150.43 <o,f0,male> different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 150.43 163.93 <o,f0,male> there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from ma bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 163.93 172.65 <o,f0,male> those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cell phones these are cell phones of the future
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 172.65 179.60 <o,f0,male> my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair trimmer and creme brulee torch and if
BarrySchwartz_2005G A S115 179.60 181.89 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 181.89 192.51 <o,f0,male> if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 192.51 201.64 <o,f0,male> and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 201.64 215.06 <o,f0,male> in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true health care it is no longer the case in the united states that you
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 215.06 224.04 <o,f0,male> go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you well we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 224.04 233.25 <o,f0,male> and these risks b has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 233.25 245.59 <o,f0,male> a has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 245.59 267.95 <o,f0,male> and the result is we call it patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 267.95 282.08 <o,f0,male> to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask our prescriptions to be changed
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 282.08 291.09 <o,f0,male> something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice as this slide
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 291.09 303.34 <o,f0,male> is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 303.34 309.23 <o,f0,male> you want to be in with respect to marriage and family
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 309.23 321.76 <o,f0,male> there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 321.76 331.02 <o,f0,male> not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 331.02 341.66 <o,f0,male> and i assign twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 341.66 349.40 <o,f0,male> asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 349.40 361.85 <o,f0,male> all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer

BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 364.04 365.16 <o,f0,male> work
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 365.16 377.66 <o,f0,male> we are blessed as carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel
BarrySchwartz_2005G A S115 377.66 382.94 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 382.94 392.41 <o,f0,male> there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the where the hi wifi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 392.41 401.56 <o,f0,male> so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 401.56 414.65 <o,f0,male> we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cell phone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 414.65 420.97 <o,f0,male> every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game we are also asking ourselves should i answer this
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 420.97 432.55 <o,f0,male> cell phone call should i respond to this email should i draft this letter and even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 432.55 445.38 <o,f0,male> so everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in looked like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G A S115 445.38 447.42 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 447.42 456.23 <o,f0,male> that is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this and the question is
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 456.23 462.63 <o,f0,male> is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes
BarrySchwartz_2005G A S115 462.63 465.54 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 465.54 476.02 <o,f0,male> we all know what's good about it so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it all of this choice has two effects two negative effects on people
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 476.02 489.20 <o,f0,male> one effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 489.20 500.62 <o,f0,male> i'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to
BarrySchwartz_2005G A S115 500.62 501.77 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 501.77 511.15 <o,f0,male> investment records from vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 511.15 518.94 <o,f0,male> for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 518.94 540.67 <o,f0,male> you offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five why because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 540.67 554.20 <o,f0,male> understand that not only does this mean that people are gonna have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 554.20 568.69 <o,f0,male> by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G A S76 568.69 574.98 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 574.98 582.53 <o,f0,male> you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong salad dressing
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 582.53 590.16 <o,f0,male> so that's one effect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 590.16 600.08 <o,f0,male> we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from and there are several reasons for this
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 600.08 612.47 <o,f0,male> one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what salad dressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 612.47 625.16 <o,f0,male> and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 625.16 632.39 <o,f0,male> the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 632.39 644.43 <o,f0,male> second what economists call opportunity costs dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much the the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 644.43 653.75 <o,f0,male> well when there are lots of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject

BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 655.18 660.69 <o,f0,male> that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen here is an example
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 660.69 664.21 <o,f0,male> for those of you who aren't new yorkers i apologize
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 664.21 677.41 <o,f0,male> but here's what you're supposed to be thinking here's this couple on the hamptons very expensive real estate gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves what could be better well damn it this guy is thinking it's august
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 677.41 684.45 <o,f0,male> everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away i could be parking right in front of my building
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 684.45 694.41 <o,f0,male> and he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 694.41 704.66 <o,f0,male> opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific and the more options there are to consider
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 704.66 711.50 <o,f0,male> the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs here's another example
BarrySchwartz_2005G A S115 711.50 716.09 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 716.09 727.31 <o,f0,male> now now this cartoon makes a lot of points it makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing you're
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 727.31 734.78 <o,f0,male> choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive third
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 734.78 744.19 <o,f0,male> escalation of expectations this hit me when i went to replace my jeans i wear jeans almost all the time and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 744.19 756.48 <o,f0,male> and you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times they started to feel feel ok so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones and i said i
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 756.48 776.65 <o,f0,male> you know i want a pair of jeans here's my size and the shopkeeper said do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit you want button fly or zipper fly you want stonewashed or acid washed do you want them distressed you want boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah on and on he went my jaw dropped and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind
BarrySchwartz_2005G A S115 776.65 781.09 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 781.09 783.72 <o,f0,male> he had no idea what that was
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 783.72 796.78 <o,f0,male> so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans and i walked out of the store truth with the best fitting jeans i had ever had i did better all this choice made it possible for me to do better
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 796.78 805.52 <o,f0,male> but i felt worse why i wrote a whole book to try and explain this to myself the reason is
BarrySchwartz_2005G A S115 805.52 809.92 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 809.92 820.76 <o,f0,male> the reason i felt worse is that with all of these options available my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 820.76 834.75 <o,f0,male> i had very low exp i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor when they came in a hundred flavors damn it one of them should've been perfect and what i got was good but it wasn't perfect and so i compared what i got to what i expected
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 834.75 840.41 <o,f0,male> and what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected adding options to people's lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 840.41 855.02 <o,f0,male> can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when they're good results nobody in the world of marketing knows this
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 855.02 857.81 <o,f0,male> cause if they did
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 857.81 863.26 <o,f0,male> you wouldn't all know what this was about the truth is more like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G A S115 863.26 866.74 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 866.74 877.75 <o,f0,male> the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 877.75 888.87 <o,f0,male> nowadays the world we live in we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection the expectation the best you can ever hope for is that this stuff is as good as you expect it to be
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 888.87 902.31 <o,f0,male> you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations my expectations have gone through the roof the secret to happiness this is what you all came for the secret to happiness is low expectations
BarrySchwartz_2005G A S115 902.31 911.67 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 911.67 927.69 <o,f0,male> i want to say just a little autobiographical moment that i i actually am married to a wife and and she's really quite wonderful i couldn't have done better i didn't settle but settling isn't always such a bad thing finally
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 927.69 941.16 <o,f0,male> one consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why who's responsible the answer is clear the world is responsible what could you do
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 941.16 954.01 <o,f0,male> when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 954.01 967.94 <o,f0,male> you could have done better with a thous with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display there is no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even though though the results of the decisions are good they feel disappointed
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 967.94 991.51 <o,f0,male> about them they blame themselves clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation i believe a significant not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves they think they're at fault
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 991.51 998.70 <o,f0,male> and so the net result is that we do better and in general objectively and we feel worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 998.70 1006.15 <o,f0,male> so let me remind you this is the official dogma the one that we all take to be true
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1006.15 1014.31 <o,f0,male> and it's all false it is not true there's no question that some choice is better than none
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1014.31 1026.31 <o,f0,male> but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice there's some magical amount i don't know what it is i'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1026.31 1036.51 <o,f0,male> our welfare now as a policy matter i'm almost done as a policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1036.51 1045.00 <o,f0,male> in industrial societies is material affluence there are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1045.00 1054.76 <o,f0,male> where the their problem is not that they have too much choice their problem is that they have too little so the stuff i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1054.83 1065.67 <o,f0,male> affluent western societies and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this steve levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install

BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1066.90 1070.78 <o,f0,male> infants child seats don't help
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1070.78 1083.08 <o,f0,male> it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices it's not simply that they don't help they actually hurt they actually make us worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1083.08 1094.45 <o,f0,male> off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1094.45 1105.03 <o,f0,male> not only would those people's lives be improved but ours would be improved also this is what economists call a pareto improving move income redistribution will make everyone
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1105.03 1112.79 <o,f0,male> better off not just poor people because of how all this excess choice plagues us so to conclude
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1112.79 1121.92 <o,f0,male> you're supposed to read this cartoon and being a sophisticated person say ah what does this fish know you know nothing is possible in this fishbowl

BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1122.95 1131.51 <o,f0,male> impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world and that's the way i read it at first the more i thought about it however the more i came to the view that this
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1131.51 1143.08 <o,f0,male> fish knows something because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible you don't have freedom you have paralysis
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1143.08 1150.08 <o,f0,male> if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1150.08 1158.42 <o,f0,male> you increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction everybody needs a fishbowl this one is almost certainly too limited
BarrySchwartz_2005G A Barry_Schwartz 1158.42 1169.05 <o,f0,male> perhaps even for the fish certainly for us but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery and i suspect disaster thank you very much

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 12.20 15.72 <o,f0,male> what i'm going to show you first as quickly as i can is
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 15.72 24.25 <o,f0,male> is some some foundational work some some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago this is seadragon
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 24.25 40.62 <o,f0,male> and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of of visual data we're looking at many many gigabytes of of digital photos here and kind of seam seamlessly and continuously zooming in panning through the thing rearranging it in any way we want and
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 40.62 54.60 <o,f0,male> it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at how big these collections are or how big the images are in the most of them are ordinary digital camera photos but this one for example is a scan from the library of congress and it's in the in the three hundred megapixel range
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 54.60 62.85 <o,f0,male> it doesn't doesn't make any difference because the only thing that that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 62.85 74.52 <o,f0,male> it's also very flexible architecture this is an entire book this is an example of non non image data this is bleak house by dickens every every column is a is a chapter
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 74.52 83.35 <o,f0,male> and to prove to you that it's that it's really text and not an image we can do something like so to really show that this is a real representation of the text it's not a picture
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 83.35 98.47 <o,f0,male> maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e book i wouldn't recommend it this is a more realistic case this is an issue of the guardian every large image is the beginning of a section and this really gives you the the the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 98.47 108.86 <o,f0,male> of a magazine or a newspaper which is an inherently multi scale kind of medium we've also done a little something with the corner of of this particular issue of the guardian we've made up a fake ad
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 108.86 121.34 <o,f0,male> that's very high resolution much higher than you'd be able to get in an ordinary ad and we've embedded extra content if you want to see the features of this car you can see it here or other models or even technical specifications
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 121.34 134.12 <o,f0,male> and and this this really this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with with those limits on on screen real estate we hope that this means no more no more pop ups and other kind of rubbish like that shouldn't be necessary
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 134.12 142.99 <o,f0,male> of course mapping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this and and this one i really won't spend any time on except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A S44 142.99 144.29 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 144.29 148.40 <o,f0,male> but those are all the roads in the in the u s superimposed on top of a nasa

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 149.84 171.41 <o,f0,male> geospatial image so let's pull up now something else so this is actually live on the live on the web now you can go check it out this is a project called photosynth which really marries two different technologies one of them is seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by noah snavely a graduate student at the university of washington co advised by steve seitz at u w and rick szeliski at microsoft research
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 171.41 182.72 <o,f0,male> a very nice collaboration and so this is this live on the web it's powered by seadragon you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views where we can we can we can dive through images and have this kind of multi resolution experience
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 182.72 196.97 <o,f0,male> but but the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful the computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these these shots all taken near grassi lakes in the canadian rockies
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 197.03 206.23 <o,f0,male> all these shots were taken so you see elements here of of stabilized slide show or panoramic panoramic imaging
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 206.23 220.84 <o,f0,male> and these things have all been related related spatially i'm not sure if i have if i have time to show you any other environments there are some that are much more spatial but i would like to jump straight to to one of noah's original data sets and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first got working in the summer
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 220.84 233.57 <o,f0,male> to show you what i think is really the the punchline behind this this technology the photosynth technology and it's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we've put up on the website we we had to worry about the lawyers and so on
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 233.63 241.09 <o,f0,male> this is a reconstruction of notre dame cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from flickr you just type notre dame into flickr
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 241.09 251.95 <o,f0,male> and you get some pictures of guys in t shirts and of the campus and so on and each of these orange cones represents an image that was that was discovered to belong to this model

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 253.30 259.99 <o,f0,male> and so these are all these are all flickr images and they've all been related spatially in this way and we can just navigate in this very simple way

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 270.83 276.92 <o,f0,male> you know i never i never thought that i'd end up working at microsoft it's very it's very gratifying to to have this kind this kind of reception here

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 280.63 294.57 <o,f0,male> so so this is i guess you can see this is very this is lots of different types of cameras it's everything from cell phone cameras to professional slrs quite a large number of them stitched together in this environment and if i can i'll find some of the sort of weird ones
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 294.57 298.56 <o,f0,male> so many of them are occluded by faces and and so on

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 299.61 312.56 <o,f0,male> there's somewhere in here there is actually there there is series of photographs here we go this is actually a poster of notre dame that registered correctly here we can dive in from the poster to a physical view
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 312.56 314.56 <o,f0,male> of this of this environment
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A S44 314.56 318.57 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 318.57 329.96 <o,f0,male> what what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment this is this is now taking data from everybody from the entire collective memory of of visually what the earth looks like
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 329.96 341.75 <o,f0,male> and link all of that together all of those photos become linked together and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts you have a a model that emerges of the entire earth think of this as the long tail to stephen lawler's
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 341.75 353.53 <o,f0,male> virtual earth work and this is something that grows in complexity as people use it and whose benefits become greater to the users as they as they use it their own photos are getting tagged with meta data that somebody else entered
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 353.53 359.82 <o,f0,male> if if somebody bothered to to tag all of these saints and say who they all are then then my photo of
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 359.82 370.08 <o,f0,male> notre dame cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data and i can use it as an entry point to dive into that space into that meta verse using everybody else's photos and and do a kind of a cross modal
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 370.08 380.65 <o,f0,male> and and and cross user social experience that way and of course a by product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of of every interesting part of the earth
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 380.71 388.67 <o,f0,male> collected not just from from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on but from the collective memory thank you so much

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A S62 400.16 408.12 <o,f0,male> do i do i understand this do i understand this right that what what your software is going to allow is that at some point really within the next few years
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A S62 408.12 409.89 <o,f0,male> all the pictures
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A S62 409.96 414.19 <o,f0,male> that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 414.20 419.24 <o,f0,male> yes what this is really doing is discovering it's creating hyperlinks if you will between between images
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 419.24 428.68 <o,f0,male> and it's doing that based on the content inside the images and that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information that a lot of those images have like when you do a web search for images
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 428.68 442.22 <o,f0,male> you type in phrases and the text on the web page is is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of now what if that picture links to all of your pictures then the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of richness that comes out of that is really huge it's a classic network effect
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 A S62 442.22 444.42 <o,f0,male> blaise that is truly incredible congratulations

BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 23.36 39.11 <o,f0,male> the largest scientific experiment ever attempted twenty seven kilometers in circumference its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to six hundred million times a second it's nothing if not ambitious this is the machine below geneva
BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 39.11 48.14 <o,f0,male> we take the pictures of those mini big bangs inside detectors this is the one i work on it's called the atlas detector forty four meters wide twenty two meters in diameter
BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 48.14 56.84 <o,f0,male> spectacular picture here of atlas under construction so you can see the scale on the tenth of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time
BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 56.84 66.45 <o,f0,male> and this picture was taken by atlas it caused immense celebration in the control room it's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the lhc
BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 66.45 77.14 <o,f0,male> colliding with a piece of the lhc deliberately and showering particles into the detector in other words when we saw that picture on september tenth we knew the machine worked which is a great triumph
BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 77.14 90.54 <o,f0,male> i don't know whether this got the biggest cheer or this when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact about a week later we had a problem with the machine
BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 90.54 103.47 <o,f0,male> related actually to these bits of wire here these gold wires those wires carry thirteen thousand amps when the machine is working in full power now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say no they don't they're small wires
BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 103.47 114.28 <o,f0,male> they can do that because when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire so at minus two hundred and seventy one degrees colder than the space between the stars those wires can take that current
BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 114.28 129.16 <o,f0,male> in one of the joints between over nine thousand magnets in lhc there was a manufacturing defect so the wire heated up slightly and its thirteen thousand amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance this was the result
BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 129.16 137.25 <o,f0,male> now that's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over twenty tons and they moved about a foot so we damaged about
BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 137.25 152.55 <o,f0,male> fifty of the magnets we had to take them out which we did we reconditioned them all fixed them they're all on their way back underground now by the end of march the lhc will be intact again we will switch it on and we expect to take data in june or july
BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 152.55 166.91 <o,f0,male> and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are now of course in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge
BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 166.91 174.22 <o,f0,male> it's easy to refute i think that the fact that it's so difficult the fact that we're overreaching is the value of things like the lhc
BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 174.22 193.78 <o,f0,male> i will leave the final word to an english scientist humphrey davy who i suspect when defending his protege's useless experiments his protege was michael faraday said this nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate
BrianCox_2009U A Brian_Cox 193.78 200.61 <o,f0,male> that there are no mysteries in nature that our triumphs are complete and that there are no new worlds to conquer
BrianCox_2009U A S32 200.61 209.82 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
CraigVenter_2008 A S32 0.00 15.66 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 15.66 31.43 <o,f0,male> you know i've talked about some of these projects before about the human genome and what that might mean and discovering new sets of genes we're actually starting at a new point we've been digitizing biology
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 31.43 35.24 <o,f0,male> and now we're trying to go from that digital code
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 35.42 43.46 <o,f0,male> into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life so we've always been trying to ask big questions
CraigVenter_2008 A S32 43.46 44.72 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 44.72 53.74 <o,f0,male> what is life is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels we've tried various approaches
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 53.74 68.57 <o,f0,male> paring it down to minimal components we've been digitizing it now for almost twenty years when we sequenced the human genome it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 68.57 73.34 <o,f0,male> now we're trying to ask can we regenerate life
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 73.34 88.94 <o,f0,male> or can we create new life out of this digital universe this is the map of a small organism mycoplasma genitalium that has the smallest genome for a species that can self replicate in the laboratory
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 88.94 94.25 <o,f0,male> and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 94.25 104.53 <o,f0,male> we're able to knock out on the order of a hundred genes out of the five hundred or so that are here but when we look at its metabolic map it's relatively simple
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 104.53 117.45 <o,f0,male> compared to ours trust me this is simple but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 117.45 126.15 <o,f0,male> so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 126.15 134.20 <o,f0,male> to ask some of these most fundamental questions and so we started down the road of can we synthesize
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 134.20 149.05 <o,f0,male> a chromosome can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before and if we do can we boot up a chromosome a chromosome by the way is just a piece of inert chemical material
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 149.05 155.26 <o,f0,male> so our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 155.26 167.02 <o,f0,male> our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing and our latest point would put it on now an exponential curve
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 167.02 177.42 <o,f0,male> we started this over fifteen years ago it took several stages in fact starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 177.42 189.16 <o,f0,male> but it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult there's tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna thirty to fifty letters in length
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 189.16 199.62 <o,f0,male> and it's a degenerate process so the longer you make the piece the more errors there are so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 199.62 216.92 <o,f0,male> and this was our first attempt starting with the digital information of the genome of phi x one seventy four it's a small virus that kills bacteria we designed the pieces went through our error correction and had a dna molecule of about five thousand letters
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 216.92 223.26 <o,f0,male> the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 223.26 241.15 <o,f0,male> and the bacteria started to read this genetic code made the viral particles the viral particles then were released from the cells then came back and killed the e coli i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model
CraigVenter_2008 A S32 241.15 242.53 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 242.53 245.32 <o,f0,male> they laughed more than you guys are it's
CraigVenter_2008 A S32 245.32 247.36 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 247.36 259.27 <o,f0,male> and so we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system but we wanted to go much larger we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 259.28 272.95 <o,f0,male> it's over five hundred and eighty thousand letters of genetic code so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 272.95 282.78 <o,f0,male> design is critical and if you're starting with digital information in the computer that digital information has to be really accurate
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 282.78 297.29 <o,f0,male> when we first sequenced this genome in nineteen ninety five the standard of accuracy was one error per ten thousand base pairs we actually found on resequencing it thirty errors had we used that original sequence it never would have been able to be booted up
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 297.29 307.79 <o,f0,male> part of the design is designing pieces that are fifty letters long that have to overlap with all the other fifty letter pieces to build smaller sub units
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 307.79 327.39 <o,f0,male> we have to design so they can go together we design unique elements into this you may have read that we put watermarks in think of this we have a four letter genetic code a c g and t triplets of that letter of those letters code for roughly twenty amino acids that there's a single letter
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 327.39 341.67 <o,f0,male> designation for each of the amino acids so we can use the genetic code to write out words sentences thoughts initially all we did was autograph it some people were disappointed there was not poetry
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 341.67 356.97 <o,f0,male> we designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes there's enzymes that repair them and put them together and we started making pieces starting with pieces that were five to seven thousand seven thousand letters
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 356.97 376.46 <o,f0,male> fit those together to make twenty four thousand letter pieces then put sets of those going up to seventy two thousand at each stage we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute we're trying to get to the point of automation
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 376.46 385.14 <o,f0,male> so this looks like a basketball playoff when we get into these really large pieces over a hundred thousand base pairs
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 385.15 391.62 <o,f0,male> they won't any longer grow readily in e coli it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 391.19 404.00 <o,f0,male> and so we turned to other mechanisms we knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair dna that can put pieces together
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 404.00 415.08 <o,f0,male> here is an example of it there's an organism called deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation you can see in the top panel its chromosome just gets blown apart
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 415.08 427.36 <o,f0,male> twelve to twenty four hours later it put it back together exactly as it was before we have thousands of organisms that can do this these organisms can be totally desiccated they can live in a vacuum
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 427.36 448.86 <o,f0,male> i am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space move around find a new aqueous environment in fact nasa has shown a lot of this is out there here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 448.86 464.77 <o,f0,male> yeast puts them together automatically this is not an electron micrograph this is just a regular photomicrograph it's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope these are pictures over about a six second period
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 464.77 479.22 <o,f0,male> so this is the publication we had just a short while ago this is over five hundred and eighty thousand letters of genetic code it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure it's over three hundred million molecular weight
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 479.22 497.31 <o,f0,male> if we print printed out at a ten font with no spacing it takes a hundred and forty two pages just to print this genetic code well how do we boot up a chromosome how how do we activate this obviously with a virus it's pretty simple it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 497.31 512.64 <o,f0,male> it's also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one and that's what you've all heard about with cloning with bacteria archaea the chromosome is integrated into the cell
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 512.64 528.19 <o,f0,male> but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it we purified a chromosome from one microbial species roughly these two are as distant as human and mice
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 528.19 544.03 <o,f0,male> we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 544.03 552.14 <o,f0,male> the new chromosome went into the cell in fact we thought this might be as far as it went but we tried to design the process a little bit further
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 552.14 571.84 <o,f0,male> this is a major mechanism of evolution right here we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species so people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 571.84 596.00 <o,f0,male> there's enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest dna the chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one the cell the chromosome we put in does it got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material chewed it up and so we ended up just with the cell with the new chromosome it turned blue because of the genes we put in it
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 596.00 607.69 <o,f0,male> and with a very short period of time all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 607.69 614.46 <o,f0,male> all the proteins changed the membranes changed when we read the genetic code it's exactly what we had transferred in
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 614.46 624.53 <o,f0,male> so this may sound like genomic alchemy but we can by moving the software dna around change things quite
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 624.53 632.68 <o,f0,male> dramatically now i've argued this is not genesis this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 632.68 644.55 <o,f0,male> and i've argued that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the cambrian explosion where there's massive new speciation based on this digital design
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 644.66 648.90 <o,f0,male> why do this i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 648.90 663.25 <o,f0,male> we're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next forty years to put it in context for myself i was born in nineteen forty six there's now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in nineteen forty six
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 663.25 679.70 <o,f0,male> within forty years there'll be four we have trouble feeding providing fresh clean water medicines fuel for the six and a half billion it's going to be a stretch to do it for nine we use over five billion tons of coal
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 679.78 682.59 <o,f0,male> thirty billion plus barrels of oil
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 682.60 699.35 <o,f0,male> that's a hundred million barrels a day when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that it's going to be a huge challenge then of course there's all that co two from this material that ends up in the atmosphere
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 699.35 710.11 <o,f0,male> we now from our discovery around the world have a database with about twenty million genes and i like to think of these as the design components of the future
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 710.11 722.98 <o,f0,male> the electronics industry only had a dozen or so components and look at the diversity that came out of that we're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 722.98 733.12 <o,f0,male> we now have techniques because of these rapid methods of synthesis to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 733.12 739.52 <o,f0,male> we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 739.52 760.87 <o,f0,male> when you think of processing these twenty million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals new vaccines we can change just with a small team do more molecular biology than the last twenty years of all science and it's just standard selection
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 760.87 767.08 <o,f0,male> we can select for viability chemical or fuel production vaccine production et cetera
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 767.08 779.96 <o,f0,male> this is a screen snapshot of some true design software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 779.96 791.01 <o,f0,male> you know we don't know necessarily what it'll look like we know exactly what their genetic code looks like we're focusing on now fourth generation fuels
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 791.01 807.20 <o,f0,male> you've seen recently corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment we have second and third generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar to much higher value fuels like octane or different types of butanol
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 807.20 829.00 <o,f0,male> but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with co two as its feedstock and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road and we think we'll have the first fourth generation fuels in about eighteen months
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 829.00 831.82 <o,f0,male> sunlight and co two is one method
CraigVenter_2008 A S32 831.82 836.36 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 836.36 853.28 <o,f0,male> but in our discovery around the world we have all kinds of other methods this is an organism we described in nineteen ninety six it lives in the deep ocean about a mile and a half deep almost at boiling water temperatures it takes co two to methane
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 853.28 869.13 <o,f0,male> using molecular hydrogen as its energy source we're looking to see if we can take captured co two which can easily be piped to sites convert that co two back into fuel to drive this process so
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 869.13 874.60 <o,f0,male> in a short period of time we think that we might be able to increase
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 874.72 883.61 <o,f0,male> what the basic question is of what is life we're truly you know have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol chemical industry

CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 888.00 891.32 <o,f0,male> yeah if you can't do that at ted where can you
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 891.32 907.10 <o,f0,male> become a major source of energy but also we're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines you've seen this year with flu we're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 907.11 912.86 <o,f0,male> i think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 912.86 919.50 <o,f0,male> here's what the future may begin to look like with changing now the evolutionary tree
CraigVenter_2008 A Craig_Venter 919.50 937.14 <o,f0,male> speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria archea and eventually eukaryotes we're a ways away from improving people our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that thank you very much

DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 11.48 25.62 <o,f0,male> i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid playing with blocks as you figured out how to reach out and grasp pick them up and move them around you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 25.62 31.81 <o,f0,male> spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us so
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 31.81 41.11 <o,f0,male> as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects along with my adviser pattie and my collaborator jeevan kalanithi i started to wonder
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 41.11 53.61 <o,f0,male> what if when we used a computer instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically arranging it the way we wanted
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 53.61 58.99 <o,f0,male> this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer by building siftables
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 58.99 70.51 <o,f0,male> in a nutshell a siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie they're able to be moved around by hand they can sense each other they can sense their motion and they have a screen and a wireless radio
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 70.51 81.51 <o,f0,male> most importantly they're physical so like the blocks you can move them just by reaching out and grasping and siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 81.51 99.81 <o,f0,male> and as these tools become more physical more aware of their motion aware of each other and aware of the nuance of how we move them we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles so i'm going to start with some simple examples this siftable is configured to show video and if i tilt it in one direction it'll roll the video this way if i tilt it the other way
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 99.81 107.29 <o,f0,male> it rolls it backwards and these interactive portraits are aware of each other so if i put them next to each other they get interested
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 107.29 116.59 <o,f0,male> if they get surrounded they notice that too they might get a little flustered and they can also sense their motion and tilt
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 116.59 124.24 <o,f0,male> so one of the interesting implications on interaction we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 124.24 137.32 <o,f0,male> like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid so in this case we've got three siftables configured to be paint buckets and i can use them to pour color into that central one where they get mixed if we overshoot we can pour a little bit back

DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 139.53 150.53 <o,f0,male> there are also some neat possibilities for education like language math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly and view the results immediately so here i'm

DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 153.22 165.98 <o,f0,male> this is a fibonacci sequence that i'm making with a simple equation program here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash up between scrabble and boggle basically in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each siftable
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 165.98 174.40 <o,f0,male> and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary then after about thirty seconds it reshuffles and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try

DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 178.65 185.76 <o,f0,male> so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab and i managed to get them to try it out and shoot a video

DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 191.93 201.85 <o,f0,male> they really loved it and one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions all you have to say is make words and they know exactly what to do
DavidMerrill_2009 A S31 201.85 202.49 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 202.49 204.87 <o,f0,male> so here's another few people trying it out
DavidMerrill_2009 A S33 204.87 212.16 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 212.16 215.63 <o,f0,male> that's our youngest beta tester down there on the right
DavidMerrill_2009 A S33 215.63 217.01 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 217.01 225.65 <o,f0,male> turns out all he wanted to do was to stack the siftables up so to him they were just blocks
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 225.65 237.16 <o,f0,male> now this is an interactive cartoon application and we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners and this is felix actually
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 237.16 246.46 <o,f0,male> and he can bring new characters into the scene just by lifting the siftables off the table that have that character shown on them here he's bringing the sun out
DavidMerrill_2009 A S38 246.46 248.67 <o,f0,male> the sun is rising
DavidMerrill_2009 A S33 248.67 249.81 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 249.81 251.59 <o,f0,male> now he's brought a tractor into the scene
DavidMerrill_2009 A S33 251.59 254.17 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A S40 254.17 255.71 <o,f0,male> the orange tractor
DavidMerrill_2009 A S40 255.90 258.76 <o,f0,male> good job yeah
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 258.76 263.58 <o,f0,male> so by shaking the siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact
DavidMerrill_2009 A S33 263.58 264.27 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 264.27 265.73 <o,f0,male> inventing his own narrative
DavidMerrill_2009 A S51 265.73 267.82 <o,f0,female> hello
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 267.82 271.50 <o,f0,male> it's an open ended story and he gets to decide how it unfolds
DavidMerrill_2009 A S33 271.50 275.92 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A S44 275.92 277.21 <o,f0,male> fly away cat
DavidMerrill_2009 A S33 277.21 281.65 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 281.65 294.64 <o,f0,male> so the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently in which siftables act as sounds like lead bass and drums
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 294.84 304.65 <o,f0,male> each of these has four different variations you get to choose which one you want to use and you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 304.65 315.72 <o,f0,male> and you inject it by just bumping up the sound siftable against a sequence siftable there are effects that you can control live like reverb and filter you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 315.73 322.60 <o,f0,male> and then overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence so let's have a look
DavidMerrill_2009 A S33 322.60 324.76 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 324.76 327.12 <o,f0,male> we'll start by putting a lead
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 327.12 331.81 <o,f0,male> into two sequence siftables arrange them into a series
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 331.81 336.83 <o,f0,male> extend it add a little more lead now i put a bassline in
DavidMerrill_2009 A S54 336.83 342.06 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 342.06 343.99 <o,f0,male> now i'll put some percussion in
DavidMerrill_2009 A S54 343.99 348.65 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 348.65 352.49 <o,f0,male> and now i'll attach the filter to the drums so i can control the effect live
DavidMerrill_2009 A S54 352.49 354.19 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 354.19 360.06 <o,f0,male> i can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo to one one way or the other
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 360.06 363.77 <o,f0,male> and now i'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression
DavidMerrill_2009 A S54 363.77 368.67 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 368.67 376.17 <o,f0,male> i can rearrange the sequence while it plays i don't have to plan it out in advance but i can improvise changing it making it longer or shorter as i go
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 376.17 382.22 <o,f0,male> and now finally i can fade the whole sequence out using the volume siftable tilted to the left
DavidMerrill_2009 A S54 382.22 388.12 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 388.12 389.87 <o,f0,male> thank you so
DavidMerrill_2009 A S54 389.87 390.99 <o,f0,male> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 390.99 401.08 <o,f0,male> as you can see my passion is for making new human computer interfaces that are a better match to the way our brains and bodies work and today i had time to show you
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 401.08 406.50 <o,f0,male> one point in this new design space and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory
DavidMerrill_2009 A David_Merrill 406.50 420.82 <o,f0,male> so the thought i want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms thank you very much i look forward to talking with all of you

ElizabethGilbert_2009 A S183 0.00 12.80 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 12.80 27.15 <o,f0,female> i am a writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great lifelong love and fascination and i don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 27.15 37.16 <o,f0,female> something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 37.22 59.07 <o,f0,female> and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book this memoir called eat pray love which decidedly unlike any of my previous books went out in the world for some reason and became this big mega sensation international bestseller thing the result of which is that everywhere i go now people treat me like i'm doomed
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 59.08 79.14 <o,f0,female> seriously doomed doomed like they come up to me now all worried and they say aren't you afraid aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 79.14 94.42 <o,f0,female> so that's reassuring you know but it would be worse except for that i i happen to remember that over twenty years ago when i first started telling people when i was a teenager that i wanted to be a writer i was met with this same kind of sort of fear based reaction and people would say
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 94.42 111.18 <o,f0,female> aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A S183 111.18 112.33 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 112.33 115.64 <o,f0,female> like that you know and a a the answer
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 115.65 128.00 <o,f0,female> the short answer to all those questions is yes yes i'm afraid of all those things and i always have been and i'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess at like
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 128.00 148.14 <o,f0,female> seaweed and and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing the the thing that i've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do you know and what is it
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 148.14 161.55 <o,f0,female> specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know like my dad for example was a chemical engineer
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 161.55 177.28 <o,f0,female> and i don't recall once in his forty years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't come that chemical engineering block john you know how's it going it just didn't come up like that you know but
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 176.87 187.00 <o,f0,female> to be fair right chemical engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives and
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 187.18 202.02 <o,f0,female> we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation and not not just writers but creative people across all genres it seems have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable and you know all you have to do is look at the very grim
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 202.02 214.46 <o,f0,female> death count in the twentieth century alone of of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 214.47 222.80 <o,f0,female> by their gifts you know norman mailer just before he died last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 223.00 231.43 <o,f0,female> an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know but we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 231.43 251.09 <o,f0,female> for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 251.09 269.62 <o,f0,female> like are you comfortable with that because you look at it even from an inch away and you know i'm not at all comfortable with that assumption i think it's odious and i also think it's dangerous and i don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century i think it's better if we encourage you know our great creative minds to live
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 269.62 287.49 <o,f0,female> you know and i and i i definitely know that in in my case in my situation it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that i'm in right now in my career which is you know
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 287.49 305.67 <o,f0,female> like check it out i'm pretty young i'm only about forty years old i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me and it's exceedingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book right
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 305.67 312.30 <o,f0,female> i i should just put it bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 312.30 321.30 <o,f0,female> you know so jesus what a thought you know like that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning and
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 321.30 334.55 <o,f0,female> you know i don't want to go there you know i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love and so the question becomes how you know and and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection that that the way that i have to
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 334.55 347.62 <o,f0,female> work now in order to continue writing is that i have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right i have to sort of find some way to have a a safe distance you know between me as i am writing and my
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 347.62 362.73 <o,f0,female> very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is gonna be from now on and and as i've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that i've been sort of looking across time and i've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 362.73 375.78 <o,f0,female> better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of of creativity and that search has led me to ancient greece and ancient rome
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 375.78 402.03 <o,f0,female> so stay with me cause it does circle around and back but ancient greece and ancient rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then ok people believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity daemons
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 402.03 413.14 <o,f0,female> socrates famously believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar the romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 413.14 418.41 <o,f0,female> which is great cause the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 418.41 427.32 <o,f0,female> individual they believed that a genius was this sort of magical divine entity who was believed to literally live in the walls
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 427.33 448.82 <o,f0,female> of an artist's studio kind of like dobby the house elf and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there that distance that i'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know and everyone knew that this is how it functioned
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 448.82 455.75 <o,f0,female> right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 455.75 468.16 <o,f0,female> you couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like this disembodied genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know everyone knew your genius was kind of lame and
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 468.16 473.04 <o,f0,female> this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 470.92 495.84 <o,f0,female> and then the renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine and and it's the beginning of rational humanism and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 495.84 504.75 <o,f0,female> you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and i got to tell you i think that was a huge
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 504.75 527.75 <o,f0,female> error you know i think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all divine creative unknowable eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it's like asking somebody to swallow the sun
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 527.75 536.06 <o,f0,female> you know it just completely warps and distorts egos and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance and i think the pressure of that
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 536.07 543.48 <o,f0,female> has been killing off our artists for the last five hundred years and if this is true and i i think it is true
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 543.48 556.33 <o,f0,female> the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 556.33 575.16 <o,f0,female> maybe not you know like maybe we can't just erase five hundred years of rational humanistic thought in one eighteen minute speech and there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 575.16 593.32 <o,f0,female> rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like i i'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this but the the question that i kind of want to pose is you know why not why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 593.32 602.74 <o,f0,female> in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 602.74 610.61 <o,f0,female> basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 610.61 629.15 <o,f0,female> paranormal i had this encounter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone who's now in her nineties but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 629.15 646.31 <o,f0,female> from over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of air and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and when she felt it coming because it would shake the earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was to in her words run like hell and she would run like hell to the house
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 646.31 669.04 <o,f0,female> and she would be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be running and running and running and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 669.05 688.48 <o,f0,female> and and then there were these times this is the piece i never forgot she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it right so she's like running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 688.48 703.62 <o,f0,female> she would catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A S183 703.62 705.22 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 705.22 712.78 <o,f0,female> so when i heard that i was like that's you know that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A S183 712.78 716.04 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 716.04 731.14 <o,f0,female> it's not at all my creative process i'm not the pipeline you know like i'm a mule and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day and like sweat and labor and like barrel through it really awkwardly but even i in my mulishness even i have brushed up against that thing
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 731.14 751.77 <o,f0,female> you know at times and i would imagine that a lot of you have too you know like even i have had work or ideas come through me from a source that i honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds but in fact might actually keep us sane and for me the best contemporary example
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 751.77 767.96 <o,f0,female> that i have of how to do that is the musician tom waits who i got to interview several years ago on a on a magazine assignment and we were talking about this and you know you you know tom i mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist you know like trying to
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 767.96 783.52 <o,f0,female> control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses you know that were totally internalized but then he got older and he got calmer and one day he was driving down the freeway in los angeles he told me and this is when it all changed for him and and he's like speeding along and all of a sudden he hears
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 783.52 797.79 <o,f0,female> this little fragment of melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes elusive and tantalizing and he wants it you know it's gorgeous and and he longs for it but he has no way to get it he doesn't have a piece of paper he doesn't have a pencil he doesn't have a tape recorder
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 797.79 811.76 <o,f0,female> so he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like i'm going to lose this thing you know i'm going to be haunted by this song forever and i'm not good enough and i can't do it and instead of panicking he just stopped he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 811.76 818.47 <o,f0,female> completely novel he just looked up at the sky and he said excuse me can you not see that i'm driving
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A S183 818.47 821.89 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 821.89 836.64 <o,f0,female> do i look like i can write down a song right now you know if you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when i can take care of you otherwise go bother somebody else today go bother leonard cohen you know
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 836.64 841.42 <o,f0,female> and and his whole work process changed after that not the work the work was still
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 841.43 853.16 <o,f0,female> oftentimes as dark as ever you know but the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble and released it kind of back where it came from
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 853.16 865.95 <o,f0,female> and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized tormented thing it could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange external thing that was not quite tom
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 865.95 884.99 <o,f0,female> so when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too and it already saved me once this idea it saved me when i was in the middle of writing eat pray love and i fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is gonna be a disaster this is gonna be the worst book ever written
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 884.99 905.24 <o,f0,female> not just bad but the worst book ever written and and i started to think i should just dump this project you know but then i remembered tom talking to the open air and i i i tried it so i just lifted my face up from the manuscript and i directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and i i said aloud listen you thing
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 905.24 920.38 <o,f0,female> you and i both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault right cause you can see that i am putting everything i have into this you know i don't have anymore than this so if you want it to be better then you've got to show up and do your part of the deal ok but if you don't do that
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 920.38 928.67 <o,f0,female> you know what the hell with it i'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job and i would please like the record to reflect today that i showed up for my part of the job
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A S183 928.67 932.56 <o,f0,female> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 932.56 943.19 <o,f0,female> because in the end it's like this ok centuries ago in the deserts of north africa people used to gather for these
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 943.19 960.05 <o,f0,female> moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn and they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific right but every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of these performers would actually become transcendent
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 960.05 976.60 <o,f0,female> and i know you know what i'm talking about because i know you've all seen at some point in your life a performance like this you know and it was like time would stop and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done you know a thousand nights before but everything would align
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 976.60 995.26 <o,f0,female> and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human you know he would be like lit from within and lit from below and all like lit up on fire with divinity and when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by it's name they would put their hands together and they would start to chant
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 995.27 1002.40 <o,f0,female> allah allah allah god god god that's god you know
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 1002.41 1008.74 <o,f0,female> curious historical footnote when the moors invaded southern spain they took this
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 1008.74 1027.56 <o,f0,female> custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from allah allah allah to ole ole ole which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances in spain when a performer has done something impossible and magic allah ole ole allah magnificent bravo incomprehensible there it is a glimpse of god
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 1027.56 1035.87 <o,f0,female> which is great because we need that but the tricky bit comes the next morning right for the dancer himself
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 1035.88 1050.46 <o,f0,female> when he wakes up and discovers that it's tuesday at eleven a m and he's no longer a glimpse of god he's just an aging mortal with really bad knees and you know maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again and maybe nobody will ever
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 1050.46 1060.99 <o,f0,female> chant god's name again as he spins and what is he then to do with the rest of his life this is hard this is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 1060.99 1082.80 <o,f0,female> you know but maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you but maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you you know from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished with somebody else
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 1082.80 1096.52 <o,f0,female> and you know if we think about it this way it starts to change everything you know this is how i've started to think and this is certainly how i've been thinking in the last few months you know as i've been working on the book that will soon be published as the
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 1096.52 1112.40 <o,f0,female> dangerously frighteningly overanticipated follow up to my freakish success and and and what i have to sort of keep telling myself when i get really psyched out about that is don't be afraid don't be daunted just do your job
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 1112.40 1125.72 <o,f0,female> continue to show up for your piece of it whatever that might be if your job is to dance do your dance if the divine cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 1125.73 1132.91 <o,f0,female> for just one moment through your efforts then ole and if not do your dance anyhow
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 1132.91 1143.14 <o,f0,female> and ole to you nonetheless i believe this and i feel that we must teach it ole to you nonetheless just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up
ElizabethGilbert_2009 A Elizabeth_Gilbert 1143.32 1144.42 <o,f0,female> thank you

WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 12.51 34.52 <o,f0,male> you know one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways who still feel their past in the wind touch it in stones polished by rain taste it in the bitter leaves of plants just to know that jaguar shamans still journey beyond the milky way or the
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 34.52 40.94 <o,f0,male> the myths of the inuit elders still resonate with meaning or that in the himalaya the
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 40.94 62.52 <o,f0,male> buddhists still pursue the breath of the dharma is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology and that is the idea that the world in which we live in does not exist in some absolute sense but is just one model of reality the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made albeit successfully many generations ago
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 62.52 75.42 <o,f0,male> and of course we all share the same adaptive imperatives we're all born we all bring our children into the world we go through initiation rites we have to deal with the inex inexorable separation of death so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 75.42 90.22 <o,f0,male> we all dance we all have art but what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song the rhythm of the dance in every culture and whether it is the the penan in the forests of borneo or the voodoo acolytes in haiti
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 90.22 98.81 <o,f0,male> or the warriors in the kaisut desert of northern kenya the curandero in the mountains of the andes
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 98.81 107.64 <o,f0,male> or a ca caravanserai in the middle of the sahara this is incidentally the fellow that i travelled into the desert with a month ago
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 107.65 123.31 <o,f0,male> or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of qomolangma everest the goddess mother of the world all of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being other ways of thinking other ways of orienting yourself in the earth and this is an idea if you think about it can only fill you with hope
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 123.31 163.23 <o,f0,male> now together the myriad cultures of the world make up a a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet and is as important to the well being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams myths ideas inspirations intuitions brought into being by the human human imagination since the dawn of consciousness the ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy it's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species and just as the
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 163.23 180.04 <o,f0,male> biosphere has been severely eroded so too is the ethnosphere and if anything at a far greater rate no biologists for example would dare suggest that fifty percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true and yet that the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 180.04 192.41 <o,f0,male> biological diversity scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity and the great indicator of that of course is language loss when each of you in this room were born
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 192.41 214.22 <o,f0,male> there were six thousand languages spoken on the planet now a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules a language is a flash of the human spirit it's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world every language is an old growth forest of the mind a watershed a thought an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 214.22 238.47 <o,f0,male> and of those six thousand languages as we sit here today in monterey fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children they're no longer being taught to babies which means effectively unless something changes they're already dead what could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence to be the last of your people to speak your language to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 238.47 248.77 <o,f0,male> children and yet that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks because every two weeks some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 248.77 260.29 <o,f0,male> of an ancient tongue and i know there's some of you who say well wouldn't it be better wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language and i say great let's make that language yoruba let's make it cantonese let's make it
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 260.29 270.25 <o,f0,male> kogi and you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language and so what i'd like to do with you today is sort of take you
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 270.25 278.60 <o,f0,male> on a journey through the ethnosphere a brief journey through the ethnosphere to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 278.61 285.59 <o,f0,male> now there are many of us who sort of
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 285.60 295.62 <o,f0,male> forget that when i say different ways of being i really do mean different ways of being take for example this child of barasana in northwest amazon the
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 295.62 305.16 <o,f0,male> people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes now this is a people who cognitively
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 305.16 327.12 <o,f0,male> do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called linguistic exogamy you must marry someone who speaks a different language and this is all rooted in the mythological past yet the curious thing is in these long houses where there are six or seven languages spoken
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 327.12 334.22 <o,f0,male> because of intermarriage you never hear anyone practicing a language they simply listen and then begin to speak
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 334.22 360.73 <o,f0,male> or one of the most fascinating tribes i ever lived with the waorani of northeastern ecuador an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in nineteen fifty eight in nineteen fifty seven five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake they dropped from the air eight by ten glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two dimensional in their lives they picked up these photographs from the forest floor
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 360.73 387.78 <o,f0,male> tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure found nothing and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil so they speared the five missionaries to death but the waorani didn't just spear outsiders they speared each other fifty four percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other we traced genealogies back eight generations and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old so we speared him anyway
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 387.78 413.42 <o,f0,male> but at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing their hunters could smell animal urine at forty paces and tell you what species left it behind in the early eighties i had a really astonishing assignment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of duvalier's strength and tonton macoutes and securing the poison used to make zombies
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 413.42 433.70 <o,f0,male> in order to make sense out of sensation of course i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of vodoun and voodoo is not a black magic cult on the contrary it's a complex metaphysical worldview it's interesting if i asked you to name the great religions of the world what would you say christianity islam buddhism judaism whatever there's always one continent left out the
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 433.70 440.38 <o,f0,male> assumption being that sub saharan africa had no religious beliefs well of course they did and voodoo is simply the distillation of these very
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 440.38 463.37 <o,f0,male> profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era but what makes voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead so the living give birth to the spirits the spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living so that for that brief shining moment the acolyte becomes the god that's why the voodooists like to say that
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 463.38 474.22 <o,f0,male> you white people go to church and speak about god we dance in the temple and become god and because you are possessed you are taken by the spirit how can you be harmed so you see these astonishing
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 474.22 482.69 <o,f0,male> demonstrations voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity a rather astonishing example of the ability of the
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 482.69 492.41 <o,f0,male> mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation now of all the peoples that i've ever been with the most extraordinary are the kogi
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 492.41 508.11 <o,f0,male> of the sierra nevada de santa marta in northern colombia descendants of the ancient tairona civilization which once carpeted the caribbean coastal plain of colombia in the wake of the conquest these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the caribbean coastal plain
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 508.11 526.98 <o,f0,male> in a bloodstained continent these people alone were never conquered by the spanish to this day they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary the young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 526.98 539.44 <o,f0,male> for eighteen years two nine year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's womb now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother and for this entire time they
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 539.44 569.45 <o,f0,male> are inculturated into the values of their society values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic or we might say the ecological balance and at the end of this amazing initiation one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives at the age of eighteen they see a sunrise and in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 569.45 578.75 <o,f0,male> and the priest steps back and says you see it's it's really as i've told you it is that beautiful it is yours to protect they call themselves the elder brothers and they say
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 578.75 592.58 <o,f0,male> we who are the younger brothers are the ones responsible for destroying the world now this level of intuition becomes very important whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape we either invoke rousseau and the old canard of the no no the
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 592.58 628.02 <o,f0,male> noble savage which is an idea racist in its simplicity or alternatively we invi invoke thoreau and say these people are closer to the earth than we are well indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia there's not a lot not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the asmat or in the chilling winds of tibet but they have nevertheless through time and ritual forged a traditional mystique of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self consciously close to it but on a far subtler intuition the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness now what does that mean
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 628.02 639.18 <o,f0,male> it means that a young kid from the andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 639.18 659.73 <o,f0,male> resource or that place than a young kid from montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant what's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world i was raised in the forests of british columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 659.73 673.36 <o,f0,male> that made me a different human being than my friends among the kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of huxwhukw and the crooked beak of heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world spirits they would have to engage during their hamatsa initiation
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 673.36 691.26 <o,f0,male> now if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries take this plant here it's a photograph i took in the northwest amazon just last april this is ayahuasca which many of you have heard about the most powerful psychoactive preparation of
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 691.26 704.20 <o,f0,male> the shaman's repertoire what makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation but the elaboration of it it's made really of two different sources
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 704.20 717.36 <o,f0,male> on the one hand this woody liana which has in it a series of beta carbolines harmine harmaline mildly hallucinogenic to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness but it's mixed with the
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 717.36 731.58 <o,f0,male> leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called psychotria viridis this plant has in it some very powerful tryptamines very close to brain serotonin dimethyltryptamine five methoxydimethyltryptamine if you've ever seen the yanomami
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 731.58 749.78 <o,f0,male> blowing that snuff up their noses that that substance they make from a different set of species is also contains five methoxydimethyltryptamine to have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 749.78 753.79 <o,f0,male> it doesn't it doesn't create the it doesn't create the
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 753.79 774.30 <o,f0,male> distortion of reality it creates the dissolution of reality in fact i used to argue with my professor richard evan shultes who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the nineteen thirties i used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because the by the time you're under the effects there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 774.30 792.32 <o,f0,male> but the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase they can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the mao now the fascinating things are that the beta carbolines found within
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 792.32 806.43 <o,f0,male> that liana are mao inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine so you ask yourself a question how in a flora of eighty thousand species of vascular plants do these people find these two
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 806.43 832.71 <o,f0,male> morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts well we use that great euphemism trial and error which is exposed to be meaningless but you ask the indians and they say the plants talk to us well what does that mean this tribe the cofan has seventeen varieties of ayahuasca all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest all of which are referable to our eye
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 832.71 840.77 <o,f0,male> as one species and then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say did i thought you knew something about plants i mean don't you know anything
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 840.77 852.05 <o,f0,male> and i said no well it turns out you take each of the seventeen varieties in the night of a full moon and it sings to you in a different key now that's not going to get you a ph d at harvard but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens

WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 853.72 867.43 <o,f0,male> now the problem the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world meaning our world moves on
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 867.44 877.86 <o,f0,male> well the truth is the twentieth century three hundred years from now is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 877.86 885.24 <o,f0,male> passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet now the problem isn't change
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 885.24 906.61 <o,f0,male> all cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a in a dance with new possibilities of life and the problem is not technology itself the sioux indians did not stop being sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an american stopped being an american when he gave up the horse and buggy it's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere it is power
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 906.61 926.31 <o,f0,male> the crude face of domination and whenever you look around the world you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the penan a nomadic people
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 926.31 940.68 <o,f0,male> from southeast asia from sarawak a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers where you can see the river itself is soiled with the
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 940.68 947.80 <o,f0,male> silt that seems to be carrying half of borneo away to the south china sea where the japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 947.80 956.57 <o,f0,male> holds with raw logs ripped from the forest or in the case of the yanomami it's the disease entities that have come in in the wake of the discovery of gold or if we go
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 956.57 986.13 <o,f0,male> into the mountains of tibet where i'm doing a lot of research recently you'll see it's a crude face of political domination you know genocide the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned but ethnocide the destruction of people's way of life is not only not condemned it's universally in many quarters celebrated as part of a development strategy and you cannot understand the pain of tibet until you move through it at the ground level i once travelled six thousand miles from chengdu in western china over
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 986.13 991.66 <o,f0,male> land through southeastern tibet to lhasa with a young colleague and it was only when i got to
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 991.66 1000.58 <o,f0,male> lhasa that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about six thousand sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 1000.58 1015.44 <o,f0,male> one point two million people killed by the cadres during the cultural revolution this young man's father had been ascribed to the panchen lama that meant he was instantly killed at the time of the chinese invasion his uncle fled with his holiness in the diaspora that took the people to
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 1015.44 1038.66 <o,f0,male> nepal his mother was incarcerated for the price of for the crime of being wealthy he was smuggled into the jail at the ti at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn't bear to be without him the sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp one day she inadvertently stepped on an armband that of mao and for that transgression she was given seven years of hard labor
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 1038.66 1045.71 <o,f0,male> the pain of tibet can be impossible to bear but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold
WadeDavis_2003 A Wade_Davis 1045.71 1054.34 <o,f0,male> and in the end then it really comes down to a choice do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity
