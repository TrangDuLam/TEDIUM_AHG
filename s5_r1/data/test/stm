AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 17.82 28.81 <o,f0,female> i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i'm writing anything but
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 28.81 40.266 <o,f0,female> i'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry

AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 86.326 95.05 <o,f0,female> i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i just gotten past mangled
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 95.05 104.05 <o,f0,female> and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock

AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 104.3 109.73 <o,f0,female> uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 109.73 121.23 <o,f0,female> you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 121.23 135.45 <o,f0,female> when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using a thesaurus back then
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 135.45 149.51 <o,f0,female> i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 149.51 158.66 <o,f0,female> i'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 158.66 168.44 <o,f0,female> went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 168.44 180.666 <o,f0,female> unfortunately it's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome

AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 182.278 184.84 <o,f0,female> so it's not just about the words
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 184.84 196.18 <o,f0,female> it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 196.18 206.58 <o,f0,female> and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 206.58 214.08 <o,f0,female> verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence

AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 215.588 225.37 <o,f0,female> so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's empowered
AimeeMullins_2009P A inter_segment_gap 225.37 225.962 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 225.962 232.19 <o,f0,female> by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 232.19 242.6 <o,f0,female> we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 242.6 253.18 <o,f0,female> one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 253.18 261.72 <o,f0,female> hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 261.72 269.226 <o,f0,female> always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 269.226 278.63 <o,f0,female> i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 278.63 289.48 <o,f0,female> i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 289.48 296.89 <o,f0,female> to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 296.89 304.81 <o,f0,female> you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 304.81 312.78 <o,f0,female> and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 312.78 320.2 <o,f0,female> these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 320.2 329.56 <o,f0,female> i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 329.56 338.02 <o,f0,female> on doctor p's part to get me to do the exercises i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 338.02 349.47 <o,f0,female> but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 349.47 356.864 <o,f0,female> and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 356.864 367.83 <o,f0,female> as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 367.83 374.854 <o,f0,female> this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 374.854 385.51 <o,f0,female> but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 385.51 391.01 <o,f0,female> the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
AimeeMullins_2009P A inter_segment_gap 391.01 392.278 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 392.278 402.35 <o,f0,female> our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 402.35 419.4 <o,f0,female> my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 419.4 431.92 <o,f0,female> not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing
AimeeMullins_2009P A inter_segment_gap 431.92 433.237 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 433.237 446.75 <o,f0,female> so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
AimeeMullins_2009P A inter_segment_gap 446.75 447.76 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 447.76 458.08 <o,f0,female> and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it's an interesting thing because people
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 458.08 462.272 <o,f0,female> have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 462.272 474.43 <o,f0,female> and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 474.43 483.16 <o,f0,female> implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 483.16 491.71 <o,f0,female> is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 491.71 502.676 <o,f0,female> as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 502.676 515.12 <o,f0,female> but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 515.12 524.35 <o,f0,female> adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 524.35 533.17 <o,f0,female> and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 533.17 541.35 <o,f0,female> and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 541.35 552.15 <o,f0,female> adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 552.15 562.79 <o,f0,female> so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 562.79 573.75 <o,f0,female> and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 573.75 587.55 <o,f0,female> there's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 587.55 599.168 <o,f0,female> and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 599.168 606.64 <o,f0,female> in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 606.64 616.24 <o,f0,female> or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 616.24 625.91 <o,f0,female> disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 625.91 635.63 <o,f0,female> serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 635.63 644.4 <o,f0,female> by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 644.4 659.37 <o,f0,female> we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 659.37 669.29 <o,f0,female> and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 669.29 681.08 <o,f0,female> so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 681.08 693.7 <o,f0,female> wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
AimeeMullins_2009P A inter_segment_gap 693.7 695.864 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 695.864 704.018 <o,f0,female> embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it
AimeeMullins_2009P A inter_segment_gap 704.018 705.69 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 705.69 716.87 <o,f0,female> and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 716.87 729.03 <o,f0,female> this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 729.03 741.1 <o,f0,female> to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 741.1 753.91 <o,f0,female> conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 753.91 765.87 <o,f0,female> is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 765.87 779.774 <o,f0,female> human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don't know what we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 779.774 790.16 <o,f0,female> so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 790.16 798.72 <o,f0,female> maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 798.72 804.38 <o,f0,female> i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 804.38 811.66 <o,f0,female> now who's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 811.66 821.97 <o,f0,female> there's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 821.97 835.09 <o,f0,female> achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 835.09 849.25 <o,f0,female> their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 849.25 859.68 <o,f0,female> there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 859.68 868.86 <o,f0,female> and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 868.86 876.84 <o,f0,female> they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 876.84 883.06 <o,f0,female> few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 883.06 892.05 <o,f0,female> and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't aimee mullins
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 892.05 899.05 <o,f0,female> and i turn around and it's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i'm sorry sir i don't
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 899.05 907.2 <o,f0,female> have we met i i don't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother's womb
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 907.2 913.63 <o,f0,female> oh that guy and but of course actually
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 913.63 922.62 <o,f0,female> it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother's stories of that day because of course
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 922.62 935.65 <o,f0,female> typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 935.65 944.78 <o,f0,female> and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 944.78 953.39 <o,f0,female> had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 953.39 961.216 <o,f0,female> and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you've been making liar out of me ever since

AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 969.39 975.77 <o,f0,female> the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 975.77 985.93 <o,f0,female> whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 985.93 994.17 <o,f0,female> and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 994.17 1002.99 <o,f0,female> medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1002.99 1011.28 <o,f0,female> no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone's life
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1011.28 1022.04 <o,f0,female> and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1022.04 1031.66 <o,f0,female> and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1031.66 1041.97 <o,f0,female> see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1041.97 1055.78 <o,f0,female> and there's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1055.78 1065.39 <o,f0,female> i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i'm not so sure
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1065.39 1075.71 <o,f0,female> and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1075.71 1090.7 <o,f0,female> and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1090.7 1101.7 <o,f0,female> see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you're off if you can hand somebody the key
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1101.7 1112.4 <o,f0,female> to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1112.4 1121.74 <o,f0,female> you're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1121.74 1133.61 <o,f0,female> comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out

AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1135.42 1145.66 <o,f0,female> there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it's called the streaming trials we call it tracking
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1145.66 1151.07 <o,f0,female> here in the states it's separating students from a b c d and so on
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1151.07 1165.65 <o,f0,female> and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them a's told them they were a's told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1165.65 1174.92 <o,f0,female> they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students

AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1194.84 1203.62 <o,f0,female> the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and that's how they went about teaching them
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1203.62 1209.98 <o,f0,female> and treating them so i think
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1209.98 1212.73 <o,f0,female> that the only true disability
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1212.73 1223.82 <o,f0,female> is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1223.82 1230.96 <o,f0,female> it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine

AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1232.86 1241.12 <o,f0,female> if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1241.12 1247.94 <o,f0,female> to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1247.94 1256.8 <o,f0,female> when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1256.8 1263.35 <o,f0,female> i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1263.35 1272.91 <o,f0,female> that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1272.91 1283.32 <o,f0,female> has known god not the god of names not the god of don'ts but the god who only knows four words
AimeeMullins_2009P A AimeeMullins 1283.32 1296.59 <o,f0,female> and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you

BillGates_2010 A BillGates 15.861 19.986 <o,f0,male> i'm going to talk today about energy and climate
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 19.986 34.89 <o,f0,male> and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 34.89 44.72 <o,f0,male> but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 44.72 53.3 <o,f0,male> the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won't grow there will be too much rain not enough rain
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 53.3 53.729 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 53.729 67.27 <o,f0,male> things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so the the climate changes will be terrible for them
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 67.27 81.83 <o,f0,male> also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 81.83 91.34 <o,f0,male> uh really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 91.34 105.03 <o,f0,male> the industrial revolution and even in the nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make uh modern materials and do so many things
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 105.03 111.67 <o,f0,male> and so we're in a wonderful situation with uh electricity in the rich world
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 111.67 112.23 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 112.23 121.63 <o,f0,male> but as we make it cheaper and let's say let's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 121.63 128.79 <o,f0,male> and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 128.79 138.41 <o,f0,male> and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets emitted
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 138.41 146.63 <o,f0,male> that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 146.63 156.25 <o,f0,male> and perhaps worse the indirect effects in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 156.25 161.81 <o,f0,male> now the exact amount of how you map from a a certain increase of co two
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 161.81 173.45 <o,f0,male> to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there's some uncertainty there but not very much and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 173.45 185.88 <o,f0,male> i asked the top scientists on this several times do we really have to get down to near zero can't we just you know cut it in half or a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 185.88 201.92 <o,f0,male> the temperature will continue to rise and so that's that's a big challenge it's very different than saying you know we're a twelve feet high truck trying to get under a ten feet bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 201.92 202.722 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 202.722 210.13 <o,f0,male> now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over twenty six billion tons for each american
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 210.13 224.31 <o,f0,male> it's about twenty tons uh for people in poor countries it's less than one ton it's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 224.31 239.17 <o,f0,male> it's been constantly going up it's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 239.17 247.99 <o,f0,male> a little bit of multiplication so you've got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 247.99 256.83 <o,f0,male> the services each person's using on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 256.83 268.064 <o,f0,male> per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero uh probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero now
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 268.064 275.049 <o,f0,male> and that's back from high school algebra but let's let's take a look first we've got population
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 275.049 285.43 <o,f0,male> now the world today has six point eight billion people that's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines health care
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 285.43 294.3 <o,f0,male> reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 294.3 300.42 <o,f0,male> the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we eat
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 300.42 313.29 <o,f0,male> clothing tv heating these are very good things and getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it's a great thing
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 313.29 321.16 <o,f0,male> for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 321.16 329.91 <o,f0,male> this number on average is going to go up and so over all that will more than double the services delivered per person
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 329.91 340.92 <o,f0,male> here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and in fact these kids don't so they're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 340.92 342.384 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 342.384 353.02 <o,f0,male> now efficiency e the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 353.02 364.88 <o,f0,male> through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 364.88 376.76 <o,f0,male> some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizer or how we do air transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 376.76 386.54 <o,f0,male> and so overall here if we're optimistic we may get a reduction of a a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of six
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 386.54 399.68 <o,f0,male> but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billion to at best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor this is going to be a key one
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 399.68 411.6 <o,f0,male> and this is the amount of co two put out per each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 411.6 426.26 <o,f0,male> no if you burn natural gas no almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what we're going to have to do at a global scale
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 426.26 435 <o,f0,male> is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 435 435.968 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 435.968 449.76 <o,f0,male> the microprocessor is a miracle the personal computer is a miracle the internet and its services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don't have a deadline
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 449.76 464.58 <o,f0,male> where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually you just kind of stand by and some come along some don't this is a case where we actually have to drive it full speed and get a miracle in a a pretty tight time line
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 464.58 475.1 <o,f0,male> now i thought how could i really capture this is there some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 475.1 481.852 <o,f0,male> i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitos and somehow people enjoyed that
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 481.852 483.07 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 483.07 496.89 <o,f0,male> it it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who live with mosquitos so with energy all i could come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 496.89 508.93 <o,f0,male> would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fireflies i'm told they don't bite in fact they might not even not even leave that jar
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 508.93 510.81 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 510.81 522.22 <o,f0,male> now there's all sorts gimmicky solutions like that one but they don't really add up too much we need solutions either one or several that have
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 522.22 532.87 <o,f0,male> unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there's many directions of people seeking i really only see five that
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 532.87 545.52 <o,f0,male> can achieve the big numbers i've left out tide geothermal fusion biofuels those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 545.52 554.62 <o,f0,male> is that we're going to have to work on each of these five and we can't give up any of them because they they look daunting because they all
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 554.62 564.32 <o,f0,male> have significant challenges let's look first at the burning fossil fuels either burning coal or burning natural gas what you need to do there
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 564.32 564.938 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 564.938 576.94 <o,f0,male> seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all the co two after you've burned it going out the flue pressurize it create a liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 576.94 590.39 <o,f0,male> now we have some pilot things that do this at the sixty to eighty percent level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and agreeing on where these co two quantities should be put
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 590.39 597.17 <o,f0,male> will be hard but the toughest one here is this long term issue who's going to be sure who's going to guarantee
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 597.17 607.24 <o,f0,male> something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in in terms of nuclear or other things this is a lot of volume
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 607.24 618.01 <o,f0,male> so that's a tough one next would be nuclear it also has three big problems cost particularly in highly regulated countries is high
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 618.01 626.63 <o,f0,male> the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing could go wrong that even though you have these human operators that the fuel
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 626.63 641.82 <o,f0,male> doesn't get used for weapons and then what do you do with the waste and although it's not very large there are a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tough problems that might be solvable and so should be worked on
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 641.82 650.29 <o,f0,male> the last three of the five i've grouped together these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources and they actually
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 650.29 658.02 <o,f0,male> although it's great they don't require fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 658.02 664.89 <o,f0,male> of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 664.89 676.66 <o,f0,male> so you're talking about many square miles thousands of time more area than than you think of as a normal energy plant also these are intermittent sources the sun doesn't shine
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 676.66 683.5 <o,f0,male> all day it doesn't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn't blow all the time and so if you depend on these sources
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 683.5 692.11 <o,f0,male> you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it's not available so we've got big cost challenges here
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 692.11 706.65 <o,f0,male> we have transmission challenges for example say this energy source is outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 706.65 718.083 <o,f0,male> and to dimensionalize this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything and compared that
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 718.083 727.17 <o,f0,male> to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 727.17 734.09 <o,f0,male> of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that's going to be
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 734.09 748.85 <o,f0,male> a factor of a hundred better than the approaches we have now it's not it's not impossible but it's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the the intermittent source to be above say twenty to thirty percent
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 748.85 757.17 <o,f0,male> of what you're using if you're counting on it for a hundred percent you need a an incredible miracle battery
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 757.17 766.73 <o,f0,male> now how we're going to go forward on this what's what's the right approach is it a manhattan project what's the the thing that can get us there well we need lots
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 766.73 777.44 <o,f0,male> of companies working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need at least a hundred people and a lot of them you'll look at and say they're crazy that's good
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 777.44 784.66 <o,f0,male> and i think here in the ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 784.66 803.89 <o,f0,male> bill gross has several companies including one called esolar that has some great solar thermal technologies vinod khosla's investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities and i'm i'm trying to help back that nathan myhrvold and i actually are backing a company
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 803.89 811.93 <o,f0,male> that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear approach there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 811.93 823.39 <o,f0,male> and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising the idea of terrapower
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 823.39 833.04 <o,f0,male> is that instead of burning a part of uranium the one percent which is the u two thirty five we decided let's burn the ninety nine percent
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 833.04 840.18 <o,f0,male> the u two thirty eight it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people had talked about it for a long time
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 840.18 850.31 <o,f0,male> but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 850.31 858.94 <o,f0,male> material's approach this looks like it would work and because you're burning that ninety nine percent you have
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 858.94 873.6 <o,f0,male> greatly improved cost profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today's reactors so instead of worrying about them you just take that it's a great thing
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 873.6 883.84 <o,f0,male> it breathes this uranium as it goes along so it's kind of like a candle you can see it's it's a log there often referred to as a traveling wave reactor in terms of fuel
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 883.84 896.91 <o,f0,male> this really solves the problem i've got a picture here of a place in kentucky this is the left over the ninety nine percent where they've taken out the part they burn now so it's called depleted uranium that would power the u s
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 896.91 906.81 <o,f0,male> for hundreds of years and simply by filtering sea water in an inexpensive process you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet so
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 906.81 917.81 <o,f0,male> you know it's got lots lots of challenges ahead but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 917.81 932.7 <o,f0,male> so let's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card look like well let's go out to where we really need to get and and then look at the intermediate for twenty fifty you've heard many people talk about
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 932.7 940.56 <o,f0,male> this eighty percent reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 940.56 953.42 <o,f0,male> things going on in poor countries still some agriculture hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry cement so to get to that eighty percent the developed countries
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 953.42 963.09 <o,f0,male> including countries like china will have had to switch their electric electricity generation altogether so the other grade is are we deploying
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 963.09 972.89 <o,f0,male> this zero emission technology have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we're in the process of of getting it elsewhere that's super important
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 972.89 981.46 <o,f0,male> that's a key element of making that report card so backing up from there what should the twenty twenty report card look like
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 981.46 996.42 <o,f0,male> well it again it should have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we emit the less that sum will be of co two and therefore the less the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 996.42 1007.25 <o,f0,male> doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other which is the piece of innovation
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1007.25 1017.19 <o,f0,male> on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1017.19 1034.01 <o,f0,male> there's a lot of great books that have been written about this the al gore book our choice and the david mckay book sustainable energy without the hot air they really go through it and i think create a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broad backing for this
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1034.01 1040.36 <o,f0,male> there's a lot that has to come together so this is a wish it's a very concrete wish that
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1040.36 1049.05 <o,f0,male> we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifty years i could pick who's president i could pick a vaccine
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1049.05 1055.71 <o,f0,male> which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no co two gets invented
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1055.71 1066.01 <o,f0,male> this is the wish i would pick this is the one with the greatest impact if we don't get this wish the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1066.01 1079.99 <o,f0,male> between u s and china between poor countries and rich and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse so what do we have to do what am i appealing to you to step forward and
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1079.99 1087.33 <o,f0,male> and drive we need to go for more research funding when countries get together in places like copenhagen they shouldn't
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1087.33 1095.97 <o,f0,male> just discuss the co two they should discuss this innovation agenda and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1095.97 1104.64 <o,f0,male> on these innovative approaches we do need the market incentives co two tax cap and trade something that gets that price signal out there
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1104.64 1118.38 <o,f0,male> we need to get the message out we need to have this dialogue be a more rational more understandable dialogue including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you

BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1133.83 1139.4 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A S182 1139.4 1145.5 <o,f0,male> thank you just so i understand more about about terrapower right
BillGates_2010 A S182 1145.5 1150.06 <o,f0,male> i mean first of all what can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1150.06 1161.24 <o,f0,male> to to actually do the software buy the supercomputer hire all the great scientists which we've done that's only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1161.24 1170.34 <o,f0,male> in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions the tough thing is building the pilot reactor
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1170.34 1179.95 <o,f0,male> finding the several billion finding the regulator the location that will actually build the first one of these once you get the first one built
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1179.95 1188.32 <o,f0,male> if it works as advertised then it's just clear as day because the economics the energy density are so different than nuclear as we know it
BillGates_2010 A S182 1188.32 1201.11 <o,f0,male> and so to understand it right this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel of this sort of spent uranium and then and then and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1201.11 1210.78 <o,f0,male> that's right today you're always refueling the reactor so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out that's
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1210.78 1218.93 <o,f0,male> that's not good so if you have very very cheap fuel that you can put sixty years in just think of it as a log
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1218.93 1227.43 <o,f0,male> put it down and not have those same complexities and it just sits there and burns for the sixty years and and then it's done
BillGates_2010 A S182 1227.43 1231.56 <o,f0,male> it's a it's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1231.56 1242.89 <o,f0,male> yeah well what happens with the waste you can you can let it sit there there's a lot less waste under this approach then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1242.89 1252.84 <o,f0,male> and and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors that's our fuel
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1252.84 1263.35 <o,f0,male> to begin with so the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process
BillGates_2010 A S182 1263.35 1270.77 <o,f0,male> but in your talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here where where is there most interest in actually doing something with this
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1270.77 1279.94 <o,f0,male> well we haven't uh picked a particular place uh and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called nuclear
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1279.94 1280.98 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1280.98 1290.28 <o,f0,male> so we we we've got a lot of interest that people from the company have been in russia india china i've been back seeing the secretary of energy here talking about how this
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1290.28 1301.55 <o,f0,male> fits into the the energy agenda so i'm optimistic you know the french and japanese have done some work this is a a variant on something that has been done it's an important
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1301.55 1310.91 <o,f0,male> advance but it's like a fast reactor and a lot of countries have built them so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to to be where the first one gets built
BillGates_2010 A S182 1310.91 1319.37 <o,f0,male> so in in your mind timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1319.37 1322.14 <o,f0,male> well we need for one of these
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1322.14 1331.86 <o,f0,male> high scale electro electro generation things that's very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy that's sort of the deadline
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1331.86 1340.86 <o,f0,male> that the environment models environmental models have have have shown us that we have to meet and you know terrapower if things go well
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1340.86 1348.99 <o,f0,male> which is wishing for a lot could easily meet that and there are fortunately now dozens of companies we need it to be hundreds
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1348.99 1362.83 <o,f0,male> who likewise if their science goes well if the funding for their pilot pilot plants goes well that they they can compete for this and it's best if multiple succeed because then you could use a mix a mix of these things we certainly need one to succeed
BillGates_2010 A S182 1362.83 1368.54 <o,f0,male> in terms of big scale possible game changes is this the biggest that you're aware of out there
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1368.54 1378.35 <o,f0,male> an energy breakthrough is the the most important thing it would have been even without the environmental constraint but the environmental constraint just makes it so much
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1378.35 1379.24 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1379.24 1386.94 <o,f0,male> so much greater in the nuclear space there are other innovators you know we don't know their work as well as we know this one but
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1386.94 1394.78 <o,f0,male> the modular people that's a different approach there's a liquid type reactor which seems a little hard but maybe they say that about us
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1394.78 1395.91 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1395.91 1405.11 <o,f0,male> and so there there are different ones but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of say coal
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1405.11 1405.9 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1405.9 1419.46 <o,f0,male> and so if you can deal with the negatives which are essentially the radiation the footprint and cost the potential in terms of effect on land and various things is almost in a class of its own
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1419.46 1421.25 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A S182 1421.25 1422.21 <o,f0,> if this doesn't work
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1422.21 1424.31 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A S182 1424.31 1431.26 <o,f0,male> then what do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1431.26 1433.82 <o,f0,male> yeah if you get into that situation it's like
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1433.82 1435.52 <o,f0,male> if you've
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1435.52 1446.45 <o,f0,male> you've been over eating and you're about to have a heart attack you know then then then where do you go you may need heart surgery or something there is a line of research on what's called geoengineering
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1446.45 1452.74 <o,f0,male> which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us twenty or thirty years to get our act together
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1452.74 1460.11 <o,f0,male> now you hope that's just an insurance policy you hope you don't need to do that some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1460.11 1467.93 <o,f0,male> lazy that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you i'm not sure that's wise given the importance of the problem but
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1467.93 1478.78 <o,f0,male> there's now the the geoengineering discussion about should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1478.78 1480.76 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A S182 1480.76 1489.37 <o,f0,> climate skeptics if you had a a sentence or two to say to them how how might you persuade them that they're wrong
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1489.37 1490.82 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1490.82 1498.22 <o,f0,male> well unfortunately the skeptics come in different camps i mean the ones who make scientific arguments are very few
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1498.22 1511.2 <o,f0,male> you know are they saying there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things there are very very few things that they can even say you know there's a chance in a million of those things the main problem we have here
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1511.2 1521.99 <o,f0,male> is kind of like aids you make the mistake now and you pay for it a lot later and so when you have all sorts of urgent problems the idea of taking pain now
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1521.99 1529.09 <o,f0,male> that has to do with a gain later and a somewhat uncertain pain thing in fact the ipcc report you know that
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1529.09 1540.68 <o,f0,male> that's not necessarily the worst case and there are people in the rich world who look at ipcc and say okay you know that that isn't that big of a deal the fact is it's that uncertain part
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1540.68 1549.33 <o,f0,male> that should move us towards this but my dream here is that if you can make it economic and meet the co two constraints then the skeptics say okay
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1549.33 1554.99 <o,f0,male> i don't care that it doesn't put out co two i kind of wish it did put out co two but i guess i'll accept it because it's cheaper
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1554.99 1556.89 <o,f0,male> than what's come before
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1556.89 1560.73 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A S182 1560.73 1561.13 <o,f0,> so
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1561.13 1562.02 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A S182 1562.02 1579.59 <o,f0,male> is that would be your response to the the the bjorn lomborg argument that basically if you if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co two problem it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth it's it's it's a stupid waste of the earth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1579.59 1592.5 <o,f0,male> yeah well the actual spending on the r and d piece you know say the u s should spend ten billion a year more than it is right now it's not that dramatic it shouldn't take away from other things the thing you get into big money on
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1592.5 1607.46 <o,f0,male> and this reasonable people can disagree is when you have something that's non economic and you're trying to fund that that to me mostly is a waste unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap i believe we should try you know more
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1607.46 1614.53 <o,f0,male> things that have a potential to be far less expensive if the trade off you get into is let's make energy super super
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1614.53 1622.65 <o,f0,male> expensive then the rich can afford that i mean all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1622.65 1630.51 <o,f0,male> the disaster is for that two billion and even lomborg has changed his shtick now is why isn't the r and d
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1630.51 1639.92 <o,f0,male> getting more discussed he he's still because of his earlier stuff further associated with the skeptic camp but he's realized that's that's a pretty lonely camp and so
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1639.92 1649.78 <o,f0,male> he's making the r and d point and and so there is a a a thread of something that i i think is appropriate the r and d piece it's crazy how little it's funded
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1649.78 1650.73 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BillGates_2010 A S182 1650.73 1656.53 <o,f0,male> well bill i suspect i i speak on the behalf of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true thank you so much
BillGates_2010 A BillGates 1656.53 1656.94 <o,f0,male> thank you
BillGates_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1656.94 1766.42 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 0 16.09 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 16.09 19.402 <o,f0,male> so i've known a lot of fish in my life
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 19.402 22.991 <o,f0,male> i've loved only two
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 22.991 25.5 <o,f0,male> that first one was a
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 25.5 28.2 <o,f0,male> it was more like a passionate affair
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 28.2 30.39 <o,f0,male> it was a beautiful fish
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 30.39 32.396 <o,f0,male> flavorful textured
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 32.396 37.109 <o,f0,male> meaty a best seller on the menu what a fish
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 37.109 40.388 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 40.388 47.272 <o,f0,male> even better it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 47.272 48.14 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 48.14 50.062 <o,f0,male> so you could feel good about selling it
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 50.062 52.06 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 52.06 55.52 <o,f0,male> i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 55.52 57.97 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 57.97 62.274 <o,f0,male> one day the head of the company called and asked if i'd speak at an event
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 62.274 63.248 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 63.248 65.87 <o,f0,male> about the farm's sustainability absolutely i said
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 65.87 66.918 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 66.918 68.71 <o,f0,male> here was a company trying to solve
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 68.71 72.15 <o,f0,male> what's become this unimaginable problem for our chefs
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 72.15 73.5 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 73.5 75.17 <o,f0,male> how do we keep fish on our menus
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 75.17 77.452 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 77.452 82.17 <o,f0,male> for the past fifty years we've been fishing the seas
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 82.17 84.178 <o,f0,male> like we clear cut forests
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 84.178 85.79 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 85.79 90.94 <o,f0,male> it's hard to overstate the destruction
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 90.94 99.998 <o,f0,male> ninety percent of large fish the ones we love the tunas the halibuts the salmons swordfish they've collapsed there was nothing left
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 99.998 102.01 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 102.01 107.39 <o,f0,male> so for better or for worse aquaculture fish farming is going to be a part of our future
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 107.39 109.54 <o,f0,male> a lot of arguments against it
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 109.54 111.284 <o,f0,male> fish farms pollute
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 111.284 115.52 <o,f0,male> most of them do anyway and they're inefficient take tuna a major drawback
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 115.52 116.998 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 116.998 125.874 <o,f0,male> it's got a feed conversion ratio of fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 125.874 130.312 <o,f0,male> not very sustainable doesn't taste very good either
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 130.312 130.89 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 130.89 132.5 <o,f0,male> so here finally
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 132.5 133.16 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 133.16 136.866 <o,f0,male> was a company trying to do it right i wanted to support them
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 136.866 138.6 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 138.6 143.36 <o,f0,male> the day before the event i called the head of pr for the company
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 143.36 147.09 <o,f0,male> let's call him don
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 147.09 156.45 <o,f0,male> don i said just to get the facts straight you guys are famous for for farming so far out to sea you you don't pollute that's right he said we're so far out
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 156.45 158.99 <o,f0,male> the waste from our fish gets distributed
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 158.99 163 <o,f0,male> not concentrated and then he added
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 163 165.438 <o,f0,male> we're basically a world unto ourselves
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 165.438 167.17 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 167.17 171.606 <o,f0,male> that feed conversion ratio two point five to one he said best in the business
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 171.606 172.79 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 172.79 177.96 <o,f0,male> two point five to one great two point five to one what what are you feeding sustainable proteins he said
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 177.96 179.56 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 179.56 181.89 <o,f0,male> great i said got off the phone
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 181.89 182.47 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 182.47 184.86 <o,f0,male> and that night i was lying in bed and i thought
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 184.86 185.5 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 185.5 187.604 <o,f0,male> what the hell is a sustainable protein
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 187.604 192.08 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 192.08 199.64 <o,f0,male> so the next day just before the event i called don i said don what are some examples of sustainable proteins he said he didn't know
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 199.64 200.81 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 200.81 205.53 <o,f0,male> he would ask around well i got on the phone with a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 205.53 206.09 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 206.09 210.45 <o,f0,male> until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 210.45 211.61 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 211.61 213.14 <o,f0,male> let's call him don too
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 213.14 217.8 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 217.8 221.72 <o,f0,male> don i said what are some examples of sustainable proteins
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 221.72 222.38 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 222.38 224.09 <o,f0,male> well he mentioned some algaes
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 224.09 227.52 <o,f0,male> and some fish meals and then he said chicken pellets
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 227.52 228.682 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 228.682 231.952 <o,f0,male> i said chicken pellets he said yeah feathers skin
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 231.952 232.572 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 232.572 237.19 <o,f0,male> bone meal scraps dried and processed into feed
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 237.19 240.36 <o,f0,male> i said what percentage
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 240.36 242.64 <o,f0,male> of your feed is chicken
DanBarber_2010 A inter_segment_gap 242.64 243.58 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 243.58 245.21 <o,f0,male> thinking you know two percent

DanBarber_2010 A DanBarber 785.746 793.49 <o,f0,male> i mentioned that to miguel and he nodded he said the skin acts like a sponge it's the last defense before anything enters the body it evolved

DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 25.282 29.75 <o,f0,male> and they gave up after about forty and there were many more
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 29.75 38.57 <o,f0,male> there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers there is a lot of happiness coaching everybody would like to make people happier

DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 40.068 48.52 <o,f0,male> but in spite of all this flood of work there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 48.52 62.11 <o,f0,male> and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps this applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is
DanielKahneman_2010 A inter_segment_gap 62.11 63.424 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 63.424 76.34 <o,f0,male> the first of these trap is a reluctance to admit complexity it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we apply it to too many different things
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 76.34 88.99 <o,f0,male> i think there is one particular meaning for to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 88.99 104.99 <o,f0,male> the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory basically it's between being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 104.99 119.79 <o,f0,male> and the third is it's the focusing illusion and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects well being without distorting its importance i mean this is a real cognitive trap there's just no way of getting it right

DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 121.27 126.79 <o,f0,male> now i'd like to start with an example of somebody
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 126.79 130.64 <o,f0,male> who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 130.64 136.48 <o,f0,male> reported a story and that was the story he said he'd been listening to the symphony
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 136.48 146.77 <o,f0,male> and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added really quite emotionally
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 146.77 149.82 <o,f0,male> it ruined the whole experience
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 149.82 152.51 <o,f0,male> but it hadn't
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 152.51 168.19 <o,f0,male> what it had ruined were the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 168.19 178.63 <o,f0,male> what this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves there is an experiencing self
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 178.63 181.98 <o,f0,male> who lives in the present
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 181.98 196.32 <o,f0,male> and knows the present is capable of re living the past but basically it has only the present it's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor asks does it hurt now when i touch you here
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 196.32 198.93 <o,f0,male> and then there is a remembering self
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 198.93 202.82 <o,f0,male> and the remembering self is the one that keeps score
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 202.82 207.93 <o,f0,male> and maintains the story of our life and it's the one that the doctor
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 207.93 210.56 <o,f0,male> approaches in asking the question

DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 221.188 228.29 <o,f0,male> and the and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess of the notion of happiness
DanielKahneman_2010 A inter_segment_gap 228.29 229.6 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 229.6 233.41 <o,f0,male> now the remembering self
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 233.41 237.8 <o,f0,male> is a storyteller and that really starts with a basic
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 237.8 251.12 <o,f0,male> response of our memory it starts immediately we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells us stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 251.12 254.982 <o,f0,male> and let me begin with one example
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 254.982 268.23 <o,f0,male> this is an old study those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure i won't go into detail it's no longer painful these days but it was painful when this when this study was run in the nineteen nineties
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 268.23 277.008 <o,f0,male> they were asked to report on their pain every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their recordings and you are asked
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 277.008 286.362 <o,f0,male> who of them suffered more and it's a very easy question i mean clearly patient b suffered more his colonoscopy was longer and every
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 286.362 293.16 <o,f0,male> minute of pain that patient a had patient b had and more but now there is another question
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 293.16 296.31 <o,f0,male> how much did these patients think they suffered
DanielKahneman_2010 A inter_segment_gap 296.31 296.98 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 296.98 298.59 <o,f0,male> and here is a surprise
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 298.59 309.156 <o,f0,male> and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than patient b the stories of the colonoscopies were different
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 309.156 315.11 <o,f0,male> and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 315.11 330.46 <o,f0,male> and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great but but one of them is distinct but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 330.46 344.486 <o,f0,male> it's a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for a than for b in memory
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 344.486 354.46 <o,f0,male> now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self from the point of view of the experiencing self clearly b had a worse time
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 354.46 371.322 <o,f0,male> now what you could do with patient a and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the colonoscopy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much that will
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 371.322 384.78 <o,f0,male> cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a worse off
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 384.78 391.74 <o,f0,male> and you have the remembering self of patient a and lot better off because now you have endowed patient a
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 391.74 395.89 <o,f0,male> with a better story about his experience
DanielKahneman_2010 A inter_segment_gap 395.89 396.856 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 396.856 399.58 <o,f0,male> what defines a story
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 399.58 417.69 <o,f0,male> and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up what defines a story are changes significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated
DanielKahneman_2010 A inter_segment_gap 417.69 419.146 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 419.146 423.39 <o,f0,male> now the experiencing self lives its life
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 423.39 433.1 <o,f0,male> continuously it has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 433.1 448.06 <o,f0,male> they are lost forever i mean most of the moments of our life and i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long which means that you know in in a life there are about six hundred million of them in a month there are about six hundred thousand
DanielKahneman_2010 A inter_segment_gap 448.06 449.178 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 449.178 456.1 <o,f0,male> most of them don't leave a trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 456.1 460.088 <o,f0,male> and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 460.088 464.96 <o,f0,male> that what happens during these moments of experience is our life
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 464.96 469.734 <o,f0,male> it's the finite resource that we're spending while we're on this earth
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 469.734 479.05 <o,f0,male> and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us so we have the
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 479.05 487.33 <o,f0,male> remembering self and the experiencing self and they're really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time
DanielKahneman_2010 A inter_segment_gap 487.33 488.596 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 488.596 497.412 <o,f0,male> from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 497.412 508.58 <o,f0,male> the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation that's not the way it works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self a two week vacation is barely better
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 508.58 514.682 <o,f0,male> than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added you have not changed the story
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 514.682 528.33 <o,f0,male> and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self time has very little impact on this story
DanielKahneman_2010 A inter_segment_gap 528.33 529.956 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 529.956 538.09 <o,f0,male> now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 538.09 547.894 <o,f0,male> because if you have a patient who has had say two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose then
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 547.894 555.75 <o,f0,male> the one that chooses is the one that has you know the memory that is less bad and that's the the surgeon that will be chosen
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 555.75 568.97 <o,f0,male> the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually don't choose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 568.97 577.032 <o,f0,male> we don't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 577.032 582.368 <o,f0,male> and basically you can look at this you know as a tyranny of the remembering self
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 582.368 590.588 <o,f0,male> and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't need
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 590.588 597.28 <o,f0,male> i have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case that is that it's
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 597.28 603.1 <o,f0,male> we we go on vacations to a very large extent in the service of our remembering self
DanielKahneman_2010 A inter_segment_gap 603.1 604.084 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 604.084 607.484 <o,f0,male> and this is a bit hard to justify i think i mean i
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 607.484 615.67 <o,f0,male> how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self and
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 615.67 624.83 <o,f0,male> when i think about that i think about a vacation we had in antarctica a few years ago which was clearly the best vacation i've ever had and i think of it relatively often
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 624.83 628.832 <o,f0,male> relative to how much i think of other vacations and
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 628.832 644.2 <o,f0,male> i probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if if i had ever opened the folder with the six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 644.2 648.47 <o,f0,male> now that is three weeks and that is at most an hour and a half
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 648.47 657.87 <o,f0,male> there seems to be a discrepancy now i may be a bit extreme you know in how little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more of this
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 657.87 661.054 <o,f0,male> there is a genuine question
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 661.054 673.07 <o,f0,male> why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a thought experiment
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 673.07 681.02 <o,f0,male> imagine that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 681.02 688.834 <o,f0,male> and you'll get an amnesic drug so that you won't remember anything now would you choose the same vacation
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 688.834 694.13 <o,f0,male> and and if and if you would choose a different vacation
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 694.13 704.842 <o,f0,male> there is a conflict between your two selves and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict and it's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 704.842 713.1 <o,f0,male> then you get one answer and if you think in terms of memories you might get another answer
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 713.1 721.07 <o,f0,male> why do we pick them the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us you know with a choice between the two selves
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 721.07 731.678 <o,f0,male> now the two selves bring up two notions of happiness there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one per self
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 731.678 740.77 <o,f0,male> and so you can ask how happy is the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy are the moments in the experiencing self's life
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 740.77 750.91 <o,f0,male> and they're all happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process what are the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 750.91 756.76 <o,f0,male> getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time
DanielKahneman_2010 A inter_segment_gap 756.76 758.594 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 758.594 773.612 <o,f0,male> if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self it's a completely different thing this is not about how happily a person lives it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 773.612 783.81 <o,f0,male> very different notions anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students of well being
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 783.81 798.564 <o,f0,male> who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way the the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 798.564 811.5 <o,f0,male> and there are now efforts to measure the two separately the gallup organization has a world poll with more that half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 811.5 820.878 <o,f0,male> their experiences and there there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 820.878 826.68 <o,f0,male> and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 826.68 836.342 <o,f0,male> you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 836.342 848.668 <o,f0,male> and vice versa you know just to give you a sense of the correlation the correlation is about point five what that means is if you met somebody and you were told oh his father is six feet tall
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 848.668 858.95 <o,f0,male> would how much would you know about his height well you would know something about his height but there's a lot of uncertainty you have that much uncertainty if i tell you that somebody
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 858.95 867.02 <o,f0,male> ranked their life eight on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 867.02 882.35 <o,f0,male> so the correlation is low we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self we know that money is very important goals are very important we know that happiness is mainly
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 882.35 885.6 <o,f0,male> being satisfied with people that we like
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 885.6 896.69 <o,f0,male> spending time with people that we like there are other pleasures but this is dominant so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves you are going to end up doing very different things
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 896.69 907.68 <o,f0,male> the bottom line of what i've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being it is a completely different notion
DanielKahneman_2010 A inter_segment_gap 907.68 908.998 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 908.998 917.16 <o,f0,male> now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that
DanielKahneman_2010 A inter_segment_gap 917.16 919.274 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 919.274 930.25 <o,f0,male> we do not attend the same to the same things when we think about life and we actually live so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 930.25 942.24 <o,f0,male> you are not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier in california if if say you live in ohio
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 942.24 952.758 <o,f0,male> and what happens is when you think about living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 952.758 965.882 <o,f0,male> and that contrast say is in climate well it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and is not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 965.882 970.57 <o,f0,male> but now because the reflective self is in charge
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 970.57 980.708 <o,f0,male> you may end up some people may end up moving to california and it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happier
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 980.708 985.588 <o,f0,male> well their experiencing self is not going to get happier we know that
DanielKahneman_2010 A inter_segment_gap 985.588 987.14 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 987.14 990.396 <o,f0,male> but one thing will happen they will think they are happier
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 990.396 998.222 <o,f0,male> because when they think about it they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 998.222 1006.27 <o,f0,male> and they will feel they made the right decision it is very difficult to think straight about well being and
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 1006.27 1010.99 <o,f0,male> i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is thank you

DanielKahneman_2010 A S164 1020.06 1024.85 <o,f0,male> thank thank you so much now when we were on the phone a few weeks ago
DanielKahneman_2010 A S164 1024.85 1030.49 <o,f0,male> you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallup survey
DanielKahneman_2010 A S164 1030.49 1034.21 <o,f0,male> is that is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now sure
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 1034.21 1046.44 <o,f0,male> sure i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallup survey is a number which we absolutely did not expect to find we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self
DanielKahneman_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1046.44 1048.06 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 1048.06 1054.19 <o,f0,male> when you know we looked at how at how feelings vary with income
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 1054.19 1068.44 <o,f0,male> and it turns out that below an income of sixty thousand dollars a year for americans and that's a very large sample of americans like six hundred thousand so it's a large representative sample below an income of six hundred thousand dollars a year
DanielKahneman_2010 A S164 1068.44 1069.39 <o,f0,male> six sixty thousand
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 1069.39 1070.48 <o,f0,male> sixty thousand

DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 1072.72 1086.16 <o,f0,male> sixty thousand sixty thousand dollars a year people are unhappy and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get above that we get an absolutely flat line i mean i've rarely seen lines so flat
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 1086.16 1094.48 <o,f0,male> clearly what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness but lack of money certainly buys you misery
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 1094.48 1099.37 <o,f0,male> and we can measure that misery very very clearly in terms of
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 1099.37 1108.1 <o,f0,male> the other self the remembering self you get a different story the more money you earn the more satisfied you are that does not hold for emotions
DanielKahneman_2010 A S164 1108.1 1113.9 <o,f0,male> but danny the the whole american endeavor is about you know life liberty the pursuit of happiness

DanielKahneman_2010 A S164 1115.01 1122.74 <o,f0,male> if people took seriously that finding i mean it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about
DanielKahneman_2010 A S164 1122.74 1132.73 <o,f0,male> you know for example taxation policy and so forth is is there any chance that politicians that the country generally would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 1132.73 1146.82 <o,f0,male> you know i think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy the recognition is going to be slow in the united states no question about that but in the uk it is happening and in other countries it is happening
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 1146.82 1152.96 <o,f0,male> people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of policy of happiness when they think of public policy

DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 1153.68 1167.55 <o,f0,male> it's going to take a while and it's not going to and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life evaluation so we need to have that debate fairly soon how to enhance happiness
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 1167.55 1180.16 <o,f0,male> goes very different ways depending on how you think and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self this is going to influence policy i think in years to come in the united states efforts are being made
DanielKahneman_2010 A DanielKahneman 1180.16 1188.29 <o,f0,male> to measure the experience happiness of the population this is going to be i think within the next decade or two part of national statistics
DanielKahneman_2010 A S164 1188.29 1192.25 <o,f0,male> well it seems to me this issue will or at least should be
DanielKahneman_2010 A S164 1192.25 1198.31 <o,f0,male> the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics

EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 31.66 45.67 <o,f0,male> is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real in other words sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies the placebo effect just because the person thinks
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 45.67 63.388 <o,f0,male> that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a for pain management for example if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 63.388 80.04 <o,f0,male> in order for us to understand each other i want to start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick and i'm going to show you how it works this is a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the nineteen fifties i learned it myself from cub scout magic in the nineteen seventies
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 80.04 89.97 <o,f0,male> i'll do it for you and then i'll explain it and then i'll explain why i explained it ok so here is what happens the knife which you can examine my hand which you could examine
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 89.97 99.49 <o,f0,male> i'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this i'll get my sleeve back and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve i'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here right
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 99.49 107.8 <o,f0,male> that way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as i'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve and the object of this is quite simple
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 107.8 108.7 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 108.7 113.88 <o,f0,male> i'm going to open my hand and hopefully if all is well
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 113.88 114.08 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 114.08 121.096 <o,f0,male> my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife in fact it's held so tightly in place that i can shake it
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 121.096 130.91 <o,f0,male> and the knife does not come off nothing goes up or down my sleeve no trickery and you can examine everything ta da
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 130.91 133.46 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 133.46 148.83 <o,f0,male> so this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very even though it's a very simple trick methodologically probably many of you in the room know this trick what happens is this i hold the knife in my hand
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 148.83 159.968 <o,f0,male> i say i'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve that is a lie the reason i'm holding onto my wrist is because that's actually the secret
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 159.968 170.09 <o,f0,male> of the illusion in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you this finger right here my index finger is just going to shift from where it is to a position
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 170.09 172.67 <o,f0,male> pointing out like this
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 172.67 174.33 <o,f0,male> nice one
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 174.33 177.088 <o,f0,male> someone who didn't have a childhood is out there
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 177.088 178.766 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 178.766 200.01 <o,f0,male> so it goes like this from here right and as i move around my finger shifts so we could talk about why this is deceptive why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here because the mind and the way it processes information it doesn't count one two three it groups them but that's not really what this is about right and then i open my hand up obviously it's clinging there not by animal magnetism but by
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 200.01 207.75 <o,f0,male> chicanery my index finger being there and then when i close my finger same thing as i move back
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 207.75 216.68 <o,f0,male> this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger i take this hand away you give the knife out there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors thanks now
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 216.68 217.44 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 217.44 220.69 <o,f0,male> what does that have to do with the placebo effect well
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 220.69 222.862 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 222.862 231.19 <o,f0,male> i read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open i'm not a doctor or a researcher so this to me was an astonishing thing
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 231.19 252.28 <o,f0,male> turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill that's like aspirin shaped it's just a round white pill it has some certain measurable effect but if you change the form that you give the placebo in like you make a smaller pill and color it blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 252.28 261.54 <o,f0,male> even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical they're sugar pills but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill what
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 261.54 262.02 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 262.02 269.15 <o,f0,male> that really flipped me out turns out though that that's not even where it stops if you have capsules
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 269.15 283.522 <o,f0,male> they are more effective than tablets in any form a colored capsule that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule dosage has something to do with this you know one pill twice a day is not as good at three pills
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 283.522 286.77 <o,f0,male> i don't remember the statistic now sorry but the point is
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 286.77 288.836 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 288.836 296.17 <o,f0,male> these dosages have something to do with it and the form has something and if you want the ultimate in placebo you've go to the needle
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 296.17 313.16 <o,f0,male> right a syringe with some inert a couple ccs of some inert something and you inject this into a patient well this is such a powerful image in their mind it it's so much stronger than the white pill it's a really this graph well i'll show it to you some other time when we have slides the point is
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 313.16 314.63 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 314.63 326.76 <o,f0,male> the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality it's only your belief that makes it real
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 326.76 340.506 <o,f0,male> in your body and makes a stronger effect i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 340.506 343.69 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 343.69 355.048 <o,f0,male> and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle this is a seven inch hat pin it's very very sharp
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 355.048 360.61 <o,f0,male> and i'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit ok
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 360.61 374.89 <o,f0,male> this is really my flesh this is not damian's special grown flesh that's my skin right there this is not a hollywood special effect i'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 374.89 394.666 <o,f0,male> if you're queasy if you if you faint easily i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night and some people that i didn't know and one woman almost passed out so i suggest if you if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next thirty in fact you know what i'll do the first bad part behind it you'll get to see you can look away too if you'd like to
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 394.666 402.75 <o,f0,male> so here is what happens right here the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 402.75 412.08 <o,f0,male> i'm sorry man am i freaking you out ok and then just through my skin a tiny bit and out the other side like this
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 412.08 413.972 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 413.972 417.59 <o,f0,male> now essentially we're in the same position we were in with the knife trick
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 417.59 422.538 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 422.538 423.966 <o,f0,male> sort of
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 423.966 432.678 <o,f0,male> but you can't count my fingers right now can you so let me show them to you that's one two three four five yes
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 432.678 435.145 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 435.145 442.66 <o,f0,male> i know what people think when they see this they go well he's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 442.66 443.296 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 443.296 445.21 <o,f0,male> so let me give you a little peek
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 445.21 446.13 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 446.13 448.156 <o,f0,male> how's that look out there pretty good
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 448.156 450.434 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 450.434 451.256 <o,f0,male> yeah i know
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 451.256 453.034 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 453.034 464.436 <o,f0,male> and the people in the back go okay i didn't really see that people in the satellite room are like starting to move in now let me give you good close look at this that really is my skin that is not a hollywood special effect that's my flesh
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 464.436 470.4 <o,f0,male> and i can twist that around i'm sorry if you're getting queasy look away don't look at the thing
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 470.4 475.746 <o,f0,male> people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go well yeah that looks kind of neat in
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 475.746 481.814 <o,f0,male> some sort of effect there but if it were real he would be see there's a hole there and a hole there if it were real he would be bleeding
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 481.814 483.74 <o,f0,male> let me work up some blood for you
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 483.74 488.312 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 488.312 490.978 <o,f0,male> yes there it is
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 490.978 512.16 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 512.16 520.77 <o,f0,male> normally now i would take the needle out i would clean off my arm and i would show you that there are no wounds but i think in this context and with the idea of
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 520.77 527.5 <o,f0,male> taking something fake and making it into something real i'm just going to leave it there and walk off the stage
EricMead_2009P A inter_segment_gap 527.5 530.24 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P A EricMead_2009P_EricMead 530.24 536.44 <o,f0,male> i will be seeing you several times over the next few days i hope you're looking forward to that thank you very much
GaryFlake_2010 A inter_segment_gap 0 16.06 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 16.06 27.12 <o,f0,male> if i can leave you with one big idea today it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts and instead of thinking about information overload
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 27.12 40.72 <o,f0,male> what i'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible so what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age this
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 40.72 52.45 <o,f0,male> tool that i'm using here is a little experiment it's called pivot and with pivot what i can do is i can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths say accidents and right away i see there's a different pattern that emerges
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 52.45 62.53 <o,f0,male> this is because in the mid area here people are at their most active and over here they're at their most frail we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 62.53 70.7 <o,f0,male> seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects but not for everyone if we go ahead and we filter
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 70.7 77.97 <o,f0,male> by age say forty years or less we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 77.97 87.62 <o,f0,male> and if you drill into that it's especially the case for men so you get the idea that viewing information viewing data in this way is a lot like
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 87.62 95.89 <o,f0,male> swimming in an living information info graphic and if we can do this for raw data why not do it for content as well
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 95.89 103.06 <o,f0,male> so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports illustrated ever produced
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 103.06 115.91 <o,f0,male> it's all here it's all on the web you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk with pivot you can drill into a decade you can drill into a particular year you can jump right into a specific issue
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 115.91 127.55 <o,f0,male> so i'm looking at this i see the athletes that have appeared in this issue the sports i'm a lance armstrong fan so i'll go ahead and i'll click on that which reveals for me all the issues in which lance armstrong's been a part of
GaryFlake_2010 A inter_segment_gap 127.55 130.68 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 130.68 141.41 <o,f0,male> now if i want to just kind of take a peek at these i might think well what about taking a look at all of cycling so i can step back and expand on that and i see greg lemond now
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 141.41 154.69 <o,f0,male> and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way going narrower broader backing in backing out you're not searching you're not browsing you're doing something that's actually a little bit different it's in between and
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 154.69 181.26 <o,f0,male> we think it changes the way information can be used so i want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit crazy what we're done here is we've taken every single wikipedia page and we've reduced it down to a little summary so the summary consisted of just little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from i'm only showing the top five hundred most popular wikipedia pages right here but even in this limited view
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 181.26 189.76 <o,f0,male> we can do a lot of things right away we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on wikipedia i'm going to go ahead and select government
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 189.76 198.95 <o,f0,male> now having selected government i can now see that the wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are time magazine people of the year
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 198.95 215.57 <o,f0,male> so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wikipedia page it's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them looking at one of these particular summaries i can then drill into the concept of
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 215.57 224.61 <o,f0,male> time magazine person of the year bringing up all of them so looking at these people i can see that the majority come from government
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 224.61 229.45 <o,f0,male> some have come from natural sciences
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 229.45 232.52 <o,f0,male> some fewer still have come from business
GaryFlake_2010 A inter_segment_gap 232.52 233.17 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 233.17 235.85 <o,f0,male> there's my boss and
GaryFlake_2010 A inter_segment_gap 235.85 237.11 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 237.11 239.77 <o,f0,male> one has come from music
GaryFlake_2010 A inter_segment_gap 239.77 240.6 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 240.6 245.01 <o,f0,male> and interestingly enough bono is also a ted prize winner
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 245.01 256.48 <o,f0,male> so we can go jump and take a look at all the ted prize winners so you see we're navigating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web not page to page but at a higher level of abstraction
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 256.48 268.88 <o,f0,male> and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise i'm just showing the new york times website here so pivot this application i don't want to call it a browser it's really not a browser
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 268.88 278.89 <o,f0,male> but you can view web pages with it and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this so i can step back
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 278.89 292.49 <o,f0,male> pop right back in to a specific section now the reason why this is important is because by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way i can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way so i can drill in to what i've done
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 292.49 301.8 <o,f0,male> over specific time frames here in fact is the state of all the demo that i just gave and i can sort of replay some stuff that i was looking at earlier today
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 301.8 308.58 <o,f0,male> and if i want to step back and look at everything i can slice and dice my history perhaps by my search history
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 308.58 318.69 <o,f0,male> here i was doing some nepotistic searching looking for bing over here for live labs pivot and from these i can drill into the web page and just launch them again it's one metaphor
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 318.69 325.56 <o,f0,male> repurposed multiple times and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data so
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 325.56 334.25 <o,f0,male> right now in this world we think about data as being this curse we talk about the curse of information overload we talk about
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 334.25 339.91 <o,f0,male> drowning in data what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 339.91 352.82 <o,f0,male> so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden if we can do that then instead
GaryFlake_2010 A GaryFlake 352.82 367.14 <o,f0,male> of being trapped in data we might actually extract information and instead of dealing just with information we can tease out knowledge and if we get the knowledge then maybe even there's wisdom to be found so with that i thank you

JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 16.75 27.96 <o,f0,male> i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction in high school i i took a bus to school an hour each way every day and i was always absorbed in a book
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 27.96 41.81 <o,f0,male> science fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this in in a in a narrative form this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had and and
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 41.81 45.72 <o,f0,male> you know that curiosity also manifested itself in in
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 45.72 51.55 <o,f0,male> the fact that whenever i wasn't in school i was i was out in the woods hiking and taking
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 51.55 62.48 <o,f0,male> samples frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and bringing it back looking at it under the microscope i was you know i was a real science geek but it was all about trying to understand
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 62.48 70.81 <o,f0,male> understand the world understand the the limits of of possibility and my you know love of of science fiction
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 70.81 77.18 <o,f0,male> actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happening this is in the late sixties
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 77.18 91.47 <o,f0,male> you know we were we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep oceans jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a you know a wondrous world that we could never really have
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 91.47 96.68 <o,f0,male> previously imagined so that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 96.68 111.29 <o,f0,male> and i was a an artist i could draw i could paint and and i i found that because there weren't you know video games and this saturation of cg movies and and all of this imagery in the media landscape
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 111.29 123.57 <o,f0,male> i had to create these images in my head you know we all did as kids having to read a book and through the author's description put something on on the screen the movie screen in our heads and so my
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 123.57 136.47 <o,f0,male> response to this was to paint to draw alien creatures alien worlds robots spaceships all that stuff i was endlessly getting busted in math class you know doodling behind the behind the textbook and
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 136.47 145.15 <o,f0,male> that was the creativity had to had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened the the jacques cousteau
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 145.15 157.78 <o,f0,male> shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday that that seemed pretty pretty darn unlikely
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 157.78 166.81 <o,f0,male> but i could that was a world i could really go to right here on earth that was as as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined from reading these books
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 166.81 178.03 <o,f0,male> so i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of fifteen and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 178.03 187.91 <o,f0,male> but i didn't let that daunt me i pestered my father until he finally found a a scuba class in in buffalo new york right across the border from where we live
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 187.91 194.37 <o,f0,male> and i actually got certified in a pool in a ymca in the dead of winter in buffalo new york and
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 194.37 204.3 <o,f0,male> i didn't see the ocean a a real ocean for another two years until we until we moved to california you know since then you know in in the in the intervening
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 204.3 214.81 <o,f0,male> forty years i've i've spent about three thousand hours underwater and five hundred hours of that was in submersibles and i've learned that
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 214.81 222.29 <o,f0,male> that that deep ocean environment and even the shallow oceans are so rich with with amazing life
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 222.29 228.73 <o,f0,male> that really is beyond beyond our imagination you know nature's imagination is so
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 228.73 240.14 <o,f0,male> so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what i what i see when i make these dives and my love affair with the ocean is
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 240.14 247.54 <o,f0,male> is ongoing and and just as strong as it ever was but when i when i chose a career as an adult
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 247.54 252.56 <o,f0,male> it was film making and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 252.56 267.05 <o,f0,male> this urge i had to tell stories with my my urges to create images and i was as a kid constantly drawing comic books and so on so film making was the way to put put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 267.05 278.48 <o,f0,male> i chose to tell were science fiction stories terminator aliens and the abyss and with the abyss i i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with film making so you know
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 278.48 285.33 <o,f0,male> merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 285.33 293.82 <o,f0,male> that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film which was to create this kind of liquid water creature
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 293.82 301.36 <o,f0,male> we actually embraced computer generated animation cg and
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 301.36 310.25 <o,f0,male> this this resulted in the first soft surface character cg animation that was ever in a in a movie
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 310.25 329.97 <o,f0,male> and even though the film didn't make any money barely broke even i should say i witnessed something amazing which is that the the audience the global audience was mesmerized by this apparent magic you know it's arthur clarke's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic they were seeing something magical
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 329.97 343.78 <o,f0,male> and so that that that got me very excited and i thought wow this is this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art so with terminator two which was my next film we took that much farther working with with ilm we created the liquid metal
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 343.78 356.83 <o,f0,male> dude in that film the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work and it did and we created magic again and we had the same result with an audience although we did make a little more money on that one so
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 356.83 367.61 <o,f0,male> you know drawing a line through those those two two dots of of experience came to this this is going to be a whole new world this was a whole new world of creativity for
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 367.61 377.93 <o,f0,male> for film artists so i i started a company with stan winston my good friend stan winston who is the the the premier make up and and creature designer
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 377.93 394.22 <o,f0,male> at that time and it was called digital domain and the concept of the company was that we would leap frog past the kind of analog processes of of optical printers and so on and we would go right to digital production and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 394.22 402.88 <o,f0,male> but we found ourselves lagging in the in the mid nineties in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 402.88 409.61 <o,f0,male> so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 409.61 423.94 <o,f0,male> of visual effects of cg effects beyond with realistic human emotive characters generated in cg and the main characters would all be in cg and the world would be in cg and
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 423.94 436.93 <o,f0,male> you know the envelope pushed back and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while so i shelved it and i made this other movie about a big ship that sinks
JamesCameron_2010 A inter_segment_gap 436.93 437.66 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 437.66 445.44 <o,f0,male> and you know i i went and pitched it to the studio as romeo and juliet on a ship it's going to be this epic romance passionate
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 445.44 452.855 <o,f0,male> film secretly what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real wreck of titanic and that's why i made the movie
JamesCameron_2010 A inter_segment_gap 452.855 457.01 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 457.01 470.365 <o,f0,male> and that's the truth now the studio didn't know that but i convinced them i said i said we're going to dive to the wreck we're going to film it for real we'll be using it in the opening of the film it will be really important it will be a great marketing hook and i talked them into funding an expedition
JamesCameron_2010 A inter_segment_gap 470.365 472.095 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 472.095 481.97 <o,f0,male> sounds crazy but this goes back to that theme about you know your imagination creating a reality because we actually created a reality where six months later i find myself in a russian submersible
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 481.97 489.515 <o,f0,male> two and a half miles down in the north atlantic looking at the real titanic through through a view port not a movie not hd for real
JamesCameron_2010 A inter_segment_gap 489.515 492.51 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 492.51 501.36 <o,f0,male> now that that blew my mind and you know it took a lot of preparation we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things but it struck me how much this
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 501.36 517 <o,f0,male> dive these deep dives was like a like a space mission you know where it was it was highly technical and it required enormous planning you get in this capsule you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 517 522.97 <o,f0,male> and you know i i thought wow i'm i'm like living in a science fiction movie this is really cool
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 522.97 535.26 <o,f0,male> and so i i really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration of course the curiosity the science component of it it was everything it was adventure it was curiosity it was imagination and it was an experience
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 535.26 546.87 <o,f0,male> that hollywood couldn't give me because you know i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it but i couldn't imagine what i was seeing out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 546.87 562.91 <o,f0,male> i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and and sometimes things that i had had never seen before sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them so i was completely smitten by this
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 562.91 577.81 <o,f0,male> and had to do more and so i actually made a kind of curious decision after the success of titanic i said okay you know i'm going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker and i'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 577.81 594.09 <o,f0,male> and so you know we started planning these these expeditions and we wound up going to the bismark and and exploring it with with robotic vehicles we went back to the titanic wreck we took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 594.09 605.16 <o,f0,male> and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship which had never been done nobody had ever looked inside the wreck they didn't have the means to do it so we created technology to do it
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 605.16 616.5 <o,f0,male> so you know here i am now on the deck of titanic sitting in a submersible and looking out at planks that look much like this where i knew that the that the band had played
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 616.5 627.08 <o,f0,male> and i'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the through the corridor of the of the ship you know when i say you know i'm i'm i'm operating it but my mind is in the vehicle
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 627.08 636.44 <o,f0,male> i felt like i was physically present inside the shipwreck of titanic and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience i've i've ever had because
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 636.44 646.75 <o,f0,male> i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 646.75 656.02 <o,f0,male> and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship so it was this absolutely remarkable experience and it really made me realize that
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 656.02 663.46 <o,f0,male> made me realize that the the telepresense experience that you actually can have these robotic avatars then your consciousness
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 663.46 676.23 <o,f0,male> is is in injected into the into the vehicle into this this other form of existence it was really really quite profound and maybe a little bit of a glimpse to to what might be happening you know some decades out as
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 676.23 691.2 <o,f0,male> as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in in many sort of post human futures that i that i can imagine as a science fiction fan so having done these these
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 691.2 701.41 <o,f0,male> expeditions and and you know really beginning to appreciate what was down there such as at the at the the deep ocean vents where we had these
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 701.41 709.87 <o,f0,male> amazing amazing animals they are basically aliens right here on earth they live in an environment of chemosynthesis they don't survive
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 709.87 722.01 <o,f0,male> on sunlight based system the way we do and so you're seeing animals that are living next to a five hundred degree centigrade water plumes that you think they can't possibly exist at the same time
JamesCameron_2010 A inter_segment_gap 722.01 722.54 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 722.54 728.78 <o,f0,male> i was getting very interested in space science as well again you know it's the science fiction influence as a kid
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 728.78 744.96 <o,f0,male> and i wound up getting involved with the space community really involved with with nasa sitting on the nasa advisory board planning actual space missions going to russia going to the pre cosmonaut biomedical protocols and all these sorts of things
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 744.96 755.94 <o,f0,male> to actually go and fly to the international space station with our three d camera systems and this was fascinating but what what i wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 755.94 764.95 <o,f0,male> and taking them down so that they had access astrobiologists planetary scientists people who were interested in these extremely fine environments
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 764.95 775.85 <o,f0,male> taking them down to the vents and letting them see and take samples and test instruments and so on so here we were making documentary films but actually doing science and actually doing space science
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 775.85 784.14 <o,f0,male> i'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan you know as a kid and doing this stuff for real
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 784.14 794.53 <o,f0,male> and you know along the way in this journey of discovery i learned a lot i learned a lot about science but i also learned a lot about
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 794.53 803.36 <o,f0,male> leadership now you think directors got to be a leader leader of you know captain of the ship and all that sort of thing i didn't really learn about leadership until
JamesCameron_2010 A inter_segment_gap 803.36 804 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 804 813.4 <o,f0,male> i did these expeditions because i had to at a certain point say what am i doing out here why am i doing this what do i get out of it
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 813.4 828.31 <o,f0,male> we don't make money at these damn shows you know we barely break even there is no fame in it people sort of think i went away between titanic and avatar and was buffing my nails someplace you know sitting at the beach made all these films made all these documentary films you know for a very
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 828.31 836.36 <o,f0,male> limited audience no fame no glory no money what are you doing you're doing it for the task itself for the challenge
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 836.36 845.43 <o,f0,male> and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 845.43 853.73 <o,f0,male> when a small group of people form a tightly knit team because we would do these things with ten twelve people working for years at a time
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 853.73 861.99 <o,f0,male> sometimes at sea for for for two or three months at a time and in that bond you realize that the most important thing
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 861.99 866.99 <o,f0,male> is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you that you've done a task
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 866.99 880.26 <o,f0,male> that you can't explain to someone else when you come back to the shore and you say you know we had to do this and the fiber optic and the attentuation and the this and the that all the all the technology of it and the difficulty the human performance aspects of working at sea
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 880.26 894.64 <o,f0,male> you can't explain it to people it's that thing that that maybe cops have or people in in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it creates a bond creates a bond of respect so when i came back to make my next movie which was avatar
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 894.64 906.87 <o,f0,male> i tried to apply that same principle of leadership which is that you respect your team and you earn their respect in return and it really changed the dynamic so here i was again with a small team
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 906.87 918.38 <o,f0,male> in you know in uncharted territory doing avatar coming up with new technology that didn't exist before tremendously exciting tremendously challenging and we became a family
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 918.38 935.33 <o,f0,male> over a four and half year period and it completely changed how i do movies so people have commented on how well you know you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of pandora to me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business the process itself that changed as a result of that
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 935.33 949.08 <o,f0,male> so what can we synthesize out of all this you know what's the what are the lessons learned well i think number one is curiosity it's the most powerful thing you own imagination
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 949.08 962.11 <o,f0,male> is a force that can actually manifest a reality and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world

JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 962.875 965.07 <o,f0,male> i have young film makers
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 965.07 968.945 <o,f0,male> come up to me and say you know give me some advice for doing this
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 968.945 970.74 <o,f0,male> and i say
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 970.74 984.28 <o,f0,male> don't put limitations on yourself other people will do that for you don't do it to yourself don't bet against yourself and and take risks nasa has this has this phrase that they like failure is not an option
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 984.28 994.54 <o,f0,male> but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration because it's a leap of faith and no important endeavor that required innovation
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 994.54 1005.1 <o,f0,male> was done without risk you have to be willing to take those risks so that's the thought i would leave you with is that in whatever you're doing failure
JamesCameron_2010 A JamesCameron 1005.1 1010.65 <o,f0,male> is an option but fear is not thank

JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 15.476 31.85 <o,f0,female> i'm jane mcgonigal i'm a game designer i've been making games online now for ten years and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 31.85 39.53 <o,f0,female> now i have a plan for this and it entails convincing more people including all of you to spend more time
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 39.53 48.22 <o,f0,female> playing bigger and better games right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games some of you might be thinking
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 48.22 62 <o,f0,female> that's a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future it's actually the opposite is true
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 62 69.01 <o,f0,female> three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems in fact
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 69.01 80.15 <o,f0,female> i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically i've calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of game play every week
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 80.15 91.35 <o,f0,female> so that's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea so i'll just i'll say it again let it sink in if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 91.35 99.39 <o,f0,female> i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 99.39 101.224 <o,f0,female> no i'm serious
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 101.224 110.672 <o,f0,female> i am here is why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species truly
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 110.672 120.9 <o,f0,female> this is a portrait by a photographer named phil toledano he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing and this is a classic
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 120.9 129.98 <o,f0,female> gaming emotion now if you're not a gamer you might miss some of the nuance in this photo you probably see the sense of urgency a little bit of
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 129.98 151.534 <o,f0,female> fear but intense concentration deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem if you are a gamer you will notice a few nuances here the crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is a sign of optimism and the eyebrows up is surprise this is a gamer who is on the verge of something called an epic win now
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A inter_segment_gap 151.534 152.678 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 152.678 167 <o,f0,female> oh you've heard of that okay good so we have some gamers among us so an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 167 171.59 <o,f0,female> and when you get there you are shocked to discover what you are truly capable of that's an epic win
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 171.59 183.74 <o,f0,female> this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of someone
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 183.74 196.922 <o,f0,female> who against all odds is on the verge of an epic win now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call the i'm not good at life face and this is actually me
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 196.922 229.47 <o,f0,female> making it can you see yes good this is actually me making the i'm not good at life face this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley california where i did my phd on why we're better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don't mean just good as in successful although that's part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and to cooperate and when we're in game worlds
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 229.47 241.37 <o,f0,female> i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves the most likely to help at a moment's notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes to get up after failure and try again and in real life
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 241.37 252.75 <o,f0,female> when we when we face failure when we confront obstacles we often don't feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious maybe depressed frustrated or cynical
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 252.75 265.62 <o,f0,female> we never have those feelings when we're playing games they just don't exist in games so that's what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything how can we
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 265.62 277.37 <o,f0,female> take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work so i looked at games like world of warcraft which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment and i started to notice a few things that make
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 277.37 290.44 <o,f0,female> epic wins so possible in online worlds so the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games especially in world of warcraft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 290.44 300.73 <o,f0,female> right away but not just any mission it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right so you can do it they never give you a challenge that you can't achieve
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 300.73 309.93 <o,f0,female> but it is on the the verge of what you're capable of so you have to try hard but there is no unemployment in world of warcraft there is no sitting around wringing your hands there is always something specific
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 309.93 316 <o,f0,female> and important to be done and there are also tons of collaborators everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 316 328.644 <o,f0,female> ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission it's not something that we have in real life that easily this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators and also there is this epic story this inspiring story of why we're there
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 328.644 342.88 <o,f0,female> and what we're doing and then we get all this positive feedback you guys have heard of leveling up and plus one strength and plus one intelligence we don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life when i get off this stage i'm not going to have plus one speaking and plus one
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 342.88 352.86 <o,f0,female> crazy idea plus twenty crazy idea i don't get that feedback in real life now the problem with collaborative online environments like world of warcraft
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 352.86 371.75 <o,f0,female> is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds it's just better than reality so so far collectively all the world of warcraft gamers have spent five point nine three million years solving the virtual problems of azeroth now
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 371.75 379.95 <o,f0,female> that's not necessarily a bad thing it might sound like it's a bad thing but to put that in context five point nine three million years ago was when
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 379.95 391.67 <o,f0,female> our earliest primate human ancestors stood up that was the first upright primate okay so when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 391.67 406.09 <o,f0,female> the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution which is an extraordinary thing but it's also apt because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games we are actually changing
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 406.09 416.25 <o,f0,female> what we are capable of as human beings we are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species this is true i believe this so consider this really interesting statistic
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 416.25 424.27 <o,f0,female> it was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 424.27 434.61 <o,f0,female> will have spent ten thousand hours playing online games by the age of twenty one now ten thousand hours is a really interesting number for two reasons first of all
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 434.61 446.23 <o,f0,female> for children in the united states ten thousand and eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 446.23 456.42 <o,f0,female> so we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they are learning about everything else in school
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 456.42 469.31 <o,f0,female> and some of you have probably read malcom gladwell's new book outliers so you would have heard of his theory of success the ten thousand hour theory of success it's based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 469.31 480.34 <o,f0,female> ten thousand hours at effortful study at anything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuosos at it we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world and so
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 480.34 488.91 <o,f0,female> now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers so the big question is
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 488.91 498.85 <o,f0,female> what exactly are gamers getting so good at because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 498.85 510.44 <o,f0,female> this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games these are our virtuoso gamers five hundred million people who are who are extraordinarily good at something
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 510.44 515.9 <o,f0,female> and in the next decade we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 515.9 529.84 <o,f0,female> at whatever that is if you don't know it already this is coming the game industry is developing consoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband internet so that gamers all over the world particularly in india
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 529.84 536.72 <o,f0,female> china brazil can get online they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade it will bring us up to one point five billion gamers
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 536.72 542.61 <o,f0,female> so i've started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at here are the four things i came up with
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 542.61 556.64 <o,f0,female> the first is urgent optimism okay think of this as extreme self motivation urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 556.64 563.73 <o,f0,female> gamers always believe that an epic win is possible and that it is always worth trying and trying now gamers don't sit around
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 563.73 574.63 <o,f0,female> ok gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric there is a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them even if they've beaten us badly
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 574.63 594.25 <o,f0,female> and the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone we trust that they will spend their time with us that they will play by the same rules value the same goal they'll stay with the game until it's over and so playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation and and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 594.25 607.96 <o,f0,female> blissful productivity i love it you know there is a reason why the average world of warcraft gamer plays for twenty two hours a week kind of a half time job it's because we know when we're playing a game that we're actually happier working hard than we are
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 607.96 620.73 <o,f0,female> relaxing or hanging out we know that we are optimized as human beings to do hard and meaningful work and gamers are willing to work hard all the time if they're given the right work finally epic meaning
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 620.73 634.91 <o,f0,female> gamers love to be attached to awe inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories so just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective so you all know wikipedia
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 634.91 642.12 <o,f0,female> biggest wiki in the world second biggest wiki in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of warcraft wiki
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 642.12 659.79 <o,f0,female> five million people use it every month they have compiled more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world they are building an epic story they are building epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft okay so these are four superpowers that add up
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 659.79 666.02 <o,f0,female> to one thing gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 666.02 679.35 <o,f0,female> these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world and the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world that's the problem that i'm trying to solve
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 679.35 688.38 <o,f0,female> there is an economist named edward castronova his work is brilliant he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 688.38 698.65 <o,f0,female> and he says we're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments and he's an economist so he's rational and he says
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A inter_segment_gap 698.65 700.76 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 700.76 705.4 <o,f0,female> not like me i'm a game designer i'm exuberant but he says he says
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 705.4 719.59 <o,f0,female> that this makes perfect sense because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life so he says
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 719.59 725.39 <o,f0,female> for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world now
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 725.39 737.42 <o,f0,female> i also agree that that is rational for now but it is not by any means an optimal situation we have to start making the real world work more like a game so i take my inspiration from something that happened
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 737.42 751.83 <o,f0,female> twenty five hundred years ago these are ancient dice made out of sheep's knuckles right before we had awesome game controlers we had sheep's knuckles and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 751.83 760.51 <o,f0,female> and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian herodotus you might know this history which is the history of who invented games and why
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 760.51 770.7 <o,f0,female> herodotus says that games particularly dice games were invented in the kingdom of lydia during a time of famine apparently there was such a severe famine
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 770.7 779.89 <o,f0,female> that the king of lydia decided that they had to do something crazy people were suffering people were fighting it was an extreme situation they needed an extreme solution
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 779.89 786.05 <o,f0,female> so according to herodotus they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom wide policy
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 786.05 798.41 <o,f0,female> on one day everybody would eat and on the next day everybody would play games and they would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging and immerse us in such satisfying blissful productivity
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 798.41 807.08 <o,f0,female> they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat and then on the next day they would play games and on the next day they would eat and according to herodotus
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 807.08 817.59 <o,f0,female> they passed eighteen years this way surviving through a famine by eating on one day and playing games on the next now this is exactly i think how we're using games today
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 817.59 827.34 <o,f0,female> we're using games to escape real world suffering we're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment everything that's not satisfying about real life
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 827.34 842.16 <o,f0,female> and we're getting what we need from games but it doesn't have to end there this is really exciting according to herodotus after eighteen years the famine wasn't getting better so the king decided they would play one final dice game
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 842.16 849.25 <o,f0,female> they divided the entire kingdom in half they played one dice game and the winners of that game got to go
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 849.25 857.44 <o,f0,female> on an epic adventure they would leave lydia and they would go out in search of a new place to live leaving behind just enough people
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 857.44 865.51 <o,f0,female> to survive on the resources that were available and hopefully to take the civilization somewhere else where they could thrive now this sounds crazy right
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 865.51 875.44 <o,f0,female> but recently dna evidence has shown that the etruscans who lead to the roman empire actually share the same dna as the ancient lydians and so
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 875.44 890.09 <o,f0,female> recently scientists have suggested that herodotus's crazy story is actually true and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly twenty years that could have explained the famine so this crazy story might be true they might have actually
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 890.09 903.06 <o,f0,female> saved their culture by playing games escaping to games for eighteen years and then been so inspired and and knew so much about how to come together with games that they actually saved the entire civilization that way okay we can do that
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 903.06 911.4 <o,f0,female> we've been playing warcraft since nineteen ninety four that was the first real time strategy game from the world of warcraft series that was sixteen years ago
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 911.4 919.22 <o,f0,female> they played dice games for eighteen years we've been playing warcraft for sixteen years i say we are ready for our own epic game now
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 919.22 926.73 <o,f0,female> they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world so that's where i get my twenty one billion hours a week of game play
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 926.73 934.57 <o,f0,female> from let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games until we solve real world problems now i know you're asking
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 934.57 941.91 <o,f0,female> how are we going to solve real world problems in games well that's what i have devoted my work to over the past few years at the institute for the future
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 941.91 952.96 <o,f0,female> we have this banner in our offices in palo alto and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future we do not want to try to predict the future what we want to do is make the future
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 952.96 963.93 <o,f0,female> we want to imagine the best case scenario outcome and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality we want to imagine epic wins and then give people the means to achieve the epic win
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 963.93 971.42 <o,f0,female> i'm just going to very briefly show you three games that i've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 971.42 979.47 <o,f0,female> so this is world without oil we made this game in two thousand and seven this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 979.47 990.23 <o,f0,female> the oil shortage is fictional but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil so when you come to the game
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 990.23 1010.19 <o,f0,female> you sign up you tell us where you live and then we give you real time news videos data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs what's not available how food supply is being affected how transportation is being affected if schools are closed if their is rioting and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true and then we ask you to blog about it
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1010.19 1023.77 <o,f0,female> to post videos to post photos we piloted this game with seventeen hundred players in two thousand and seven and we've tracked them for the three years since and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience nobody wants to change how they live just because
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1023.77 1030.18 <o,f0,female> it's good for the world or because we are supposed to but if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1030.18 1040.47 <o,f0,female> we've run out of oil this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on challenge yourself to see how you would survive most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1040.47 1049.74 <o,f0,female> so for the next world saving game we decided to aim higher bigger problem than just peak oil we did a game called superstruct at the institute for the future
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1049.74 1064.88 <o,f0,female> and the premise was a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only twenty three years left on the planet this supercomputer was called the global extinction awareness system of course we asked people to come online almost like a jerry bruckheimer movie
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1064.88 1072.24 <o,f0,female> you know jerry bruckheimer movies you form a dream team you've got the astronaut the scientist the ex convict and they all have something to do to save the world
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A inter_segment_gap 1072.24 1073.54 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1073.54 1079.39 <o,f0,female> but in our game instead of just having five people on the dream team we said everybody is on the dream team and it's your job
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1079.39 1086.42 <o,f0,female> to invent the future of energy the future of food the future of health the future of security and the future of the social safety net
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1086.42 1094.61 <o,f0,female> we had eight thousand people play that game for eight weeks they came up with five hundred insanely creative solutions that you can go online if you google superstruct and see
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1094.61 1101.87 <o,f0,female> so finally the last game we're launching it march third this is a game done with the world bank institute if you complete the game you will be
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1101.87 1114.8 <o,f0,female> certified by the world bank institute as a social innovator class of two thousand ten working with universities all over sub saharan africa and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills we've got a graphic novel
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1114.8 1134.38 <o,f0,female> we've got leveling up in skills like local insight knowledge networking sustainability vision and resourcefulness i would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people anywhere in the world particularly in developing areas who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1134.38 1147.24 <o,f0,female> so i'm going to wrap up now i want to ask a question what do you think happens next we've got all these amazing gamers we've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do but none of them have saved the real world yet
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1147.24 1153.06 <o,f0,female> well i hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1153.06 1168.34 <o,f0,female> to do real world work that games are a powerful platform for change we have all these amazing superpowers blissful productivity the ability to weave a tight social fabric this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning i really hope that we can come together
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1168.34 1178.91 <o,f0,female> to play games that matter to survive on this planet for another century and that's my hope that you will join me in making and playing games like this when i look forward to the next decade i know two things for sure
JaneMcGonigal_2010 A JaneMcGonigal 1178.91 1187.61 <o,f0,female> that we can make any future we can imagine and we can play any games we want so i say let the world changing games begin thank you

MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 16.11 27.84 <o,f0,male> let's pretend right here we have a machine a big machine a cool ted ish machine and it's a time machine and everyone in this room has to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 27.84 38.316 <o,f0,male> and i wonder what you'd choose because i've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i don't know they want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idol
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 38.316 47.64 <o,f0,male> i don't know i'm i'm convinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that i'm not part of that crowd i have to say
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 47.64 57.27 <o,f0,male> i don't want to go back and it's not because i'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 57.27 63.88 <o,f0,male> this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure you wish to choose health wealth
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 63.88 71.56 <o,f0,male> mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great grandparents
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 71.56 79.704 <o,f0,male> died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents are closing in on eighty so i've
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 79.704 87.33 <o,f0,male> there'd better be there'd better be a nine at the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 87.33 95.334 <o,f0,male> this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did one hundred years ago
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 95.334 98.83 <o,f0,male> think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 98.83 107.81 <o,f0,male> smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has it's gone
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 107.81 112.244 <o,f0,male> it's vanished we vanquished it puff in the rich world
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 112.244 122.41 <o,f0,male> diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist hardly diphtheria rubella polio does anyone even know what those things are

MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 123.68 134.09 <o,f0,male> vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out

MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 134.758 141.356 <o,f0,male> seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 141.356 148.12 <o,f0,male> unfortunately that's all the good news because there's some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 148.12 152.99 <o,f0,male> despite all our accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 152.99 160.552 <o,f0,male> every day that number's rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's disgraceful and not only that we've used our imagination
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 160.552 167.86 <o,f0,male> to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforest oil gas they're going away
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 167.86 173.942 <o,f0,male> and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away too
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 173.942 186.36 <o,f0,male> so the question is can we do that and i i think we can i think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 186.36 194.628 <o,f0,male> i really do believe that and no it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night
MichaelSpecter_2010 A inter_segment_gap 194.628 196.102 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 196.102 207.94 <o,f0,male> we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 207.94 220.25 <o,f0,male> and yet i actually think we'd have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battled progress when we fought about these things more vigorously on on more fronts
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 220.25 229.31 <o,f0,male> than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 229.31 240.26 <o,f0,male> everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know what you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me awhile to figure out
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 240.26 251.84 <o,f0,male> about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines for the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history
MichaelSpecter_2010 A inter_segment_gap 251.84 252.886 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 252.886 259.34 <o,f0,male> i didn't know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that
MichaelSpecter_2010 A inter_segment_gap 259.34 260.42 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 260.42 266.94 <o,f0,male> i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 266.94 280.09 <o,f0,male> i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people thought this was frankenfoods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a haphazard way was trespassing on nature's ground
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 280.09 284.25 <o,f0,male> but you know i do what i do i wrote the story i moved on i mean i'm a journalist
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 284.25 286.79 <o,f0,male> we type we file we go to dinner it's fine
MichaelSpecter_2010 A inter_segment_gap 286.79 290.904 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 290.904 302.306 <o,f0,male> but these stories bothered me and i couldn't figure out why and eventually i did and that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 302.306 306.18 <o,f0,male> they were exactly like the people in this room
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 306.18 313.29 <o,f0,male> and it it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 313.29 322.408 <o,f0,male> where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress
MichaelSpecter_2010 A inter_segment_gap 322.408 323.36 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 323.36 337.59 <o,f0,male> okay there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there there's no reason we shouldn't have you can just say a few names and people will understand
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 337.59 341.326 <o,f0,male> chernobyl bhopal the challenger
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 341.326 345.868 <o,f0,male> vioxx weapons of mass destruction hanging chads
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 345.868 349.14 <o,f0,male> i mean you know you can choose your list
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 349.14 355.47 <o,f0,male> there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right so be skeptical
MichaelSpecter_2010 A inter_segment_gap 355.47 356.468 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 356.468 363.722 <o,f0,male> ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 363.722 367.66 <o,f0,male> you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 367.66 378.434 <o,f0,male> and the reason that i can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one i've never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 378.434 384.33 <o,f0,male> that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles mumps and rubella vaccine shot
MichaelSpecter_2010 A inter_segment_gap 384.33 385.394 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 385.394 392.4 <o,f0,male> very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's a serious issue
MichaelSpecter_2010 A inter_segment_gap 392.4 393.326 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 393.326 402.43 <o,f0,male> the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 402.43 410.29 <o,f0,male> it doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 410.29 418.35 <o,f0,male> we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i i do understand that i think we all do but you know what
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 418.35 422.99 <o,f0,male> the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because here's a fact
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 422.99 428.86 <o,f0,male> the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 428.86 433.52 <o,f0,male> that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 433.52 439.39 <o,f0,male> and what kind what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 439.39 446.12 <o,f0,male> i understand it i do understand it because does anyone have measles here has one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 446.12 455.35 <o,f0,male> doesn't happen very much doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened a hundred and sixty thousand times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour
MichaelSpecter_2010 A inter_segment_gap 455.35 456.534 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 456.534 461.136 <o,f0,male> but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like jenny mccarthy
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 461.136 467.86 <o,f0,male> can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 467.86 480.2 <o,f0,male> and they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon
MichaelSpecter_2010 A inter_segment_gap 480.2 481.204 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 481.204 489.92 <o,f0,male> this guy was a hero jonas salk he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio puff gone
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 489.92 493.554 <o,f0,male> that guy in the middle not so much his name is paul offit
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 493.554 499.414 <o,f0,male> he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people it's save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 499.414 514.088 <o,f0,male> kids in the developing world every year pretty good right well it's good except that paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining and he actually says it that way so paul's a terrorist
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 514.088 524.21 <o,f0,male> when paul speaks in a public hearing he can't testify without armed guards he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 524.21 536.98 <o,f0,male> and why because paul made a vaccine i don't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have measles in this country now
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 536.98 544.81 <o,f0,male> and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it's just a numbers game and they're not just going to die of measles what about polio let's have that
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 544.81 552.976 <o,f0,male> why not a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said you know she thought i was a little strident no one's ever said that before
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 552.976 558.93 <o,f0,male> she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 558.93 569.85 <o,f0,male> why because we don't have polio and you know what we didn't have polio in this country yesterday today i don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning and he's flying to lax right now he's over ohio
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 569.85 584.44 <o,f0,male> and he's going to land in a couple hours he's going to rent a car and he's going to come to long beach and he's going to attend one of these fabulous ted dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease and we don't either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 584.44 591.54 <o,f0,male> don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves in lies we love to do it everyone take their vitamins this morning

MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 595.26 603.318 <o,f0,male> i know you did because half of americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn't matter how often we
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 603.318 610.42 <o,f0,male> find out that they're useless the data says it all the time they darken your urine they almost never do more than that

MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 631.65 636.732 <o,f0,male> it's cruel to millions of people it's absolutely astonishingly cold
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 636.732 644.5 <o,f0,male> and soul bending to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo

MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 673.15 683.58 <o,f0,male> and you know what when i say this stuff people scream at me and they say what do you care let people do what they want to do it's it's it makes them feel good and you know what you're wrong because

MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 703.488 709.85 <o,f0,male> you end up in thabo mbeki south africa he killed four hundred thousand of his people by insisting
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 709.85 724.006 <o,f0,male> that beetroot garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of aids hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 724.006 730.83 <o,f0,male> please don't tell me there are no consequences to these things there are there always are now
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 730.83 735.45 <o,f0,male> the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 735.45 744.97 <o,f0,male> proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite it's an idiotic debate it has to stop it's a debate about words about metaphors
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 744.97 747.002 <o,f0,male> it's ideology it's not science
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 747.002 757.29 <o,f0,male> every single thing we eat every grain of rice every sprig of parsley every brussel sprout has been modified by man you know there weren't tangerines in the garden of eden

MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 772.05 780.96 <o,f0,male> absolutely but we can put something like vitamin a into rice and that stuff can help millions of people millions of people prolong their lives

MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 782.196 793.8 <o,f0,male> you don't want to do that i i have to say i don't understand it we object to genetically engineered food why do we do that well the things i constantly hear are
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 793.8 797.598 <o,f0,male> too many chemicals pesticides hormones
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 797.598 801.65 <o,f0,male> monoculture we don't want giant fields of the same thing that's wrong
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 801.65 808.39 <o,f0,male> we don't want companies patenting life we don't want companies owning seeds and you know what my response to all of that is yes
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 808.39 814.53 <o,f0,male> you're right let's fix it it's true we've got a huge food problem but this isn't science
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 814.53 822.55 <o,f0,male> this has nothing to do with science it's law it's morality it's patent stuff you know science isn't a company it's not a country
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 822.55 825.82 <o,f0,male> it's not even an idea it's a process
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 825.82 836.87 <o,f0,male> it's a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 836.87 843.66 <o,f0,male> is really very deadening and it's preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 843.66 857.31 <o,f0,male> fifty years we're going to have to grow seventy percent more food than we do right now seventy percent this is investment in africa over the last thirty years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we're not giving it to them and why
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 857.31 870.53 <o,f0,male> genetically engineered food we don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff like cassava for instance cassava's something that half a billion people eat it's kind of like a potato it's just a bunch of calories it sucks
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 870.53 876.22 <o,f0,male> it doesn't have nutrients it doesn't have protein and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 876.22 885.62 <o,f0,male> and then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind they wouldn't starve and you know what that would be nice it wouldn't be chez panisse but it would be nice

MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 890.92 899.21 <o,f0,male> why are we fighting it why i mean let's ask ourselves why are we fighting it because we don't want to move genes around this is about moving genes around it's not about chemicals
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 899.21 906.64 <o,f0,male> it's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones our insistence on having bigger food better food singular food
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 906.64 915.886 <o,f0,male> this isn't about rice krispies this is about keeping people alive and it's about time we started to understand what that meant because you know something if we don't
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 915.886 926.85 <o,f0,male> if we continue to act the way we're acting we're guilty of something that i don't think we want to be guilty of high tech colonialism there's no other way to describe what's going on here it's selfish
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 926.85 931.29 <o,f0,male> it's ugly it's beneath us and we really have to stop it

MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 941.54 953.34 <o,f0,male> and absolutely absolutely i do it's stuck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on anything we want we can move it where we want to move it
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 953.34 961.48 <o,f0,male> and we're going to move it where we want to move it we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead
MichaelSpecter_2010 A MichaelSpecter 961.48 967.48 <o,f0,male> we're going to be happy we do i know that we can and as far as i'm concerned

RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 36.45 43.67 <o,f0,male> and i'm telling a story that many of you know because steve's columns became the basis for a book which was turned into a movie
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 43.67 54.02 <o,f0,male> with robert downey jr acting as steve lopez and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers the juilliard trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short

RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 57.44 72.105 <o,f0,male> nathaniel dropped out of juilliard he suffered a complete breakdown and thirty years later he was living homeless on the streets of skid row in downtown los angeles i encourage all of you to read steve's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 72.105 83.485 <o,f0,male> that formed between these two men but how music helped shape that bond and ultimately was instrumental if you'll pardon the pun in helping nathaniel get off the streets
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 83.485 107.505 <o,f0,male> i met mister ayers in two thousand eight two years ago at walt disney concert hall he had just heard a performance of beethoven's first and fourth symphonies and came backstage and introduced himself he was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about yo yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers were never going to make the world series all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement in beethoven's fourth symphony
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 107.505 119.22 <o,f0,male> and we got talking about music and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me now i should mention that nathaniel refuses treatment
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 119.22 127.96 <o,f0,male> because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorazine and handcuffs and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 127.96 136.3 <o,f0,male> but as a result now he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 136.3 146.16 <o,f0,male> and then disappearing for days wandering the streets of skid row exposed to its horrors with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 146.16 157.3 <o,f0,male> and nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at walt disney concert hall he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes he was lost
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 157.3 174.63 <o,f0,male> and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep and i was afraid not for myself but i was afraid that i was going to lose him that he was going to sink into one of his states
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 174.63 183.19 <o,f0,male> and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy
RobertGupta_2010U A inter_segment_gap 183.19 184.195 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 184.195 187.045 <o,f0,male> so i just started playing
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 187.045 198.67 <o,f0,male> and i played the first movement of the beethoven violin concerto and as i played i understood that there was a profound change occurring in nathaniel's eyes
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 198.67 205.41 <o,f0,male> it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical a chemical reaction for which my playing the music
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 205.41 212.29 <o,f0,male> was its catalyst and nathaniel's manic rage
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 212.29 220.01 <o,f0,male> was transformed into understanding a quiet curiosity and grace
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 220.01 233.015 <o,f0,male> and in a miracle he lifted his own violin and he started playing by ear certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete mendelssohn tchaikovsky sibelius
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 233.015 245.53 <o,f0,male> and we started talking about music from bach to beethoven and brahms bruckner all the b's from bartok all the way up to esa pekka salonen and i understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 245.53 255.505 <o,f0,male> but he related to this music at a personal level he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles philharmonic
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 255.505 261.43 <o,f0,male> and through playing music and talking about music this man had transformed
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 261.43 269.46 <o,f0,male> from the paranoid disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown los angeles to the charming
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 269.46 278.36 <o,f0,male> erudite brilliant juilliard trained musician music is medicine
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 278.36 291.8 <o,f0,male> music changes us and for nathaniel music is sanity because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity into reality
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 291.8 296.11 <o,f0,male> and that is an escape from his tormented state
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 296.11 307.125 <o,f0,male> and i understood that this was the very essence of art this was the very reason why we made music that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core our emotions
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 307.125 313.79 <o,f0,male> and through our artistic lens through our creativity we're able to shape those emotions into reality
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 313.79 322.94 <o,f0,male> and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us inspires and unites us
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 322.94 328.08 <o,f0,male> and for nathaniel music brought him back into a fold of friends
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 328.08 338.63 <o,f0,male> the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him that recognized his talents and respected him
RobertGupta_2010U A RobertGupta 338.63 351.17 <o,f0,male> and i will always make music with nathaniel whether we're at walt disney concert hall or on skid row because he reminds me why i became a musician thank you

TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 16.26 41.56 <o,f0,male> several years ago here at ted peter skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge and the idea's pretty simple teams of four have to build the tallest free standing structure out of twenty sticks of spaghetti one yard of tape one yard of string and a marshmallow the marshmallow has to be on top and though it seems really simple it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 41.56 49.2 <o,f0,male> and so i thought that this was an interesting idea and i incorporated it into a design workshop and it was a huge success and since then i've
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 49.2 66.66 <o,f0,male> conducted about seventy design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects even the ctos of the fortune fifty and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration and i'd like to share some of them with you so
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 66.66 87 <o,f0,male> normally most people begin by orienting themselves to the task they talk about it they figure out what it's going to look like they jockey for power then they spend some time planning organizing they sketch in they lay out spaghetti they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever growing structures and then
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 87 95.87 <o,f0,male> finally just as they're running out of time someone takes out the marshmallow and then they gingerly put it on top and they stand back
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 95.87 97.48 <o,f0,male> and ta da
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 97.48 109.54 <o,f0,male> they admire their work but what really happens most of the time is that the ta da turns into an uh oh because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse so
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 109.54 116.82 <o,f0,male> there are a number of people who have a lot more uh oh moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school
TomWujec_2010U A inter_segment_gap 116.82 119.38 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 119.38 131.52 <o,f0,male> they lie they cheat they get distracted and they produce really lame structures and of course there are teams that have a lot more ta da structures and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten
TomWujec_2010U A inter_segment_gap 131.52 132.99 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 132.99 133.34 <o,f0,male> and
TomWujec_2010U A inter_segment_gap 133.34 134.81 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 134.81 144.91 <o,f0,male> it's pretty amazing as peter tells us not only do do they produce the tallest structures but they're the most interesting structures of them all so the question you want to ask is how come
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 144.91 152.69 <o,f0,male> why what is it about them and peter likes to say that none of this none of the kids spend any time trying to be ceo of spaghetti inc
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 152.69 162.19 <o,f0,male> right they don't time spend time jockeying for power but there's another reason as well and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 162.19 169.49 <o,f0,male> right and then they execute on it and then what happens is when they put the marshmallow on the top they run out of time and what happens it's a crisis
TomWujec_2010U A inter_segment_gap 169.49 171.316 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 171.316 179.95 <o,f0,male> sound familiar right ok what kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow and they build prototypes successive prototypes
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 179.95 188.63 <o,f0,male> always keeping the marshmallow on top so they have multiple times to to fix ill built prototypes along the way so designers recognize this type of collaboration
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 188.63 196.12 <o,f0,male> as the essence of the iterative process and with each version kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 196.12 202 <o,f0,male> so the capacity to play in prototype is is really essential but let's look at how different teams perform
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 202 213.85 <o,f0,male> so the average for most people is around twenty inches business schools students about half of that lawyers a little better but not much better than that kindergarteners better than most adults who does the very best
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 213.85 217.67 <o,f0,male> architects and engineers thankfully and
TomWujec_2010U A inter_segment_gap 217.67 222.35 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 222.35 234.55 <o,f0,male> thirty nine inches is the tallest structure i i've seen and why is it because they understand triangles and self re enforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building self reinforce stable structures
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 234.55 243.81 <o,f0,male> so ceos a little bit better than average but here's where it gets interesting if you put in an executive admin on the team they get significantly better
TomWujec_2010U A inter_segment_gap 243.81 245.54 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 245.54 246.88 <o,f0,male> terrible you know
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 246.88 260.94 <o,f0,male> you look around you go oh that team's going to win you can just tell beforehand and why is that because they have specials skills of facilitation they manage the process they understand the process and any team who manages and pays a close attention to to work
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 260.94 270.44 <o,f0,male> will significantly improve the team's performance specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination leads to to strong success
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 270.44 277.76 <o,f0,male> if you have ten teams that typically perform you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures and i i tried something interesting i thought let's
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 277.76 286.93 <o,f0,male> up the ante once so i offered a ten thousand dollar prize of software to the winning team so what do you think happened to these design students what was the result
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 286.93 290.55 <o,f0,male> here's what happened
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 290.55 311.42 <o,f0,male> not one team had a standing structure not one had a a if anyone had built say a one inch structure they could have taken home the prize so isn't it interesting that high stakes have a strong impact we did the exercise again with the same students what do you think happened then so now they understand the value of prototyping
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 311.42 325.19 <o,f0,male> so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time so there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 325.19 338.57 <o,f0,male> so you might ask why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge and the reason is i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 338.57 345.12 <o,f0,male> and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions because frankly
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 345.12 369.27 <o,f0,male> every project has its own marshmallow doesn't it the challenge provides a shared experience a common language a common stance to build the right prototype and so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercise and those of you who are interested may want to go to marshmallowchallenge dot com it's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows there's step by step instructions on this there are
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 369.27 375.43 <o,f0,male> crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system there's world records on this as well
TomWujec_2010U A TomWujec 375.43 402.17 <o,f0,male> and the fundamental lesson i believe is that design truly is a contact sport it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task and that we apply the very best of our thinking our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an uh oh moment to a ta da moment and that can make a big difference thank you very much
